            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read that great Princes have ſtooped ſo low from the height of their power, that they have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed their Princely favour to the moſt abject of their people, &amp; gratefully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a few drops of fair water from the palm of a poor mans hand; which act of royal acceptance and reſpect, hath more enobled their names un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poſterity, then all their deeds of victorious Chivalry and Magnificence. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this hath imboldned me to prefer theſe papers to your Honours acceptance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The ſubject is but light, for it treats of love; but ſo interwoven with ſtories of heroical reſolution, &amp; examples of high perfection that you can read nothing in this nature more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb facs="tcp:165993:3"/> or delightfull. The Author was by birth a Spaniard, the ſame Gentleman that compoſed Guzman de Alfarache, and the ſecond part of Don Quixot, who in all his writings hath made it as much his ſtudy as his mirth, to repreſent and deride the vanity of thoſe bold inventors, whoſe wild glory it hath been, not onely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon, but to torment the imaginations of their readers; and inſtead of poſſibilities to fill their fables and the world, with Gyants and with Monſters.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard (I know not by what fate) is more happy in his proſe then in his verſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Cuentaes</hi> cannot ſo well be taught to run in numbers, or whether the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Nation is more promptly inclined to expreſſe it ſelf in Proſe then in Verſe. Howſoever though he differs in the manner, yet he agrees in the ſubſtance, for as the incomparable Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Sidney truely obſerves, it is not the rime but the invention that crowns the Poet, and verſe doth no more make a Poet, then a gown doth a Lawyer. The piece in the Original is dedicated to one of the Grandees in Spain, and of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the famous City of <hi>Mantua,</hi> at that time that <hi>Nero</hi> (whoſe cruelty hath made the world to admire his manners) was Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> dwelt an old Knight named <hi>Camillo,</hi> no leſſe adorned with vertue then favoured of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: who being about thréeſcore and ten years old, was forced to lead a ſingle life, his wife <hi>Paulina</hi> paying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her due. This <hi>Camillo</hi> being thus diſpoſſeſſed of his moſt wel-beloved Lady, with no leſſe grief bewailed her death, then with pleaſure he injoyed her preſence whileſt ſhe yet lived. But time the medicine of all ſorrow diminiſhed his grief, the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:5"/> ſooner by means of the unſpeakable pleaſure which he took in viewing the perfections of his ſon <hi>Perierio,</hi> and his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina;</hi> which Gentlewomen for their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertues and extream beauty, were of the Citizens of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> worthily termed the ſepulchres and tombs of their mother <hi>Paulinas</hi> graces and perfections, all <hi>Mantua</hi> judging that all the gifts both of fortune, nature, &amp; the mind, wherewith <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> was indued in her life time, were buried and intombed in her two daughters: neither was <hi>Perierio</hi> leſſe famous in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of vertuous conditions then his ſiſters, he being adorned with moſt excellent qualities, and inferiour to no man both in perfection of body and ſubtilty of wit.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Camillo</hi> rejoycing that he was the father of ſuch children, therein thinking himſelf to be moſt happy, lived with as great contentment as any man might do.

               <p>For <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, being informed of his wicked companions, in whoſe flattery he took pleaſure, that <hi>Camillo</hi> had two daughters in beauty ſurpaſſing natures cunning, and in perfection of body reſembling the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſent a Letter unto old <hi>Camillo,</hi> by two of his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being written after this manner.</p>

               <p>This letter was with all ſpéed by the ſaid ſaid Noblemen delivered unto <hi>Camillo,</hi> who uncloſing the ſame, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the ſeal, ſoon read that which was ſufficient to break his heart in pieces, and work his death, had not his deſtinies reſerved him to defend his daughters honeſty, and frée them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from the tyrants outragious luſt, through his ſage counſel, and politick deliberation. So that having read the Letters, after he had ſomething meditated upon the contents thereof, he gave the Noblemen anſwer, that for as much as hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a widower could not live being ſeparated from his two daughters and his ſonne <hi>Perierio,</hi> he would with his ſonne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them to the Court, there doing his Majeſty ſuch ſervice as it might pleaſe him to command, expecting the day of his departure out of this world, leaving not his daughters onely but his ſon alſo at his Majeſties pleaſure. But to the end that he might take order for the preparation of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and provide ſuch neceſſaries as were expedient for him, his ſon and his daughters, he deſired them to obtain of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty but the ſpace of one moneth, which expired, he would without all doubt be at the Court with his children. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen finding old <hi>Camillo</hi> ſo ready to pleaſure <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, promiſed him to do what they might, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But <hi>Camillo</hi> calling his ſon <hi>Perierio,</hi> with his daughters <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina</hi> to him ſending a world of tears from his eyes, which diſtilling along his pale chéeks ſtreamed on his ſilver hairs, and fetching a long ſigh from the innermoſt part his heart ſaid unto them.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:165993:6"/> to end my aged days, and with a tragical and mournfull death ſhut up all thoſe happy and bleſſed hours which the Gods have hitherto granted me. Ye have heard the Tyrants will, ye know his luſt, and likewiſe ye are not ignorant, what ſhame, what infamy, what diſhonour that would be, not onely to you two, <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina,</hi> but alſo unto me, unto your Brother, yea unto all the line and ſtock of our race and kindred. What anſwer I have made the Noble-men, is not unknown to any of you. But as I do not mean to be found as good as my word in the leaſt point of all that which I have promiſed them; ſo I am of opinion that ye cannot beléeve otherwiſe, but that my tongue ſpake further then it had command from my heart, and that my lips pronounced that which was not in my breaſt concluded. But loving children, where Luſt is a Lord, &amp; Ryot ruleth, equity and juſtice is expelled: and where a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant governeth, all is Law that he doth like. Wherefore fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſt contradiction and denial might be cauſe of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, I ſtuffed the Tyrants Meſſengers with ſuch a pleaſing and ſoothing anſwer. But to be ſhort, know, loving children, that I had rather that we ſhould all agrée to die one death, then to condiſcend unto the Tyrants outragious and lividinous deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> having heard his Fathers noble reſolution won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that ſuch courage harboured in his breaſt, he being a man of ſuch an aged life, conſidering that old men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deprived of natural heat, and ſo become cold, fearfull, and void of all heroical vertues; amazed therefore at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vertue, and rejoycing that he was the ſon of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, anſwered him in this mander. Father, the extream ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which I conceived by reaſon of <hi>Nero</hi> his hainous intent to diſgrace us with the ſpot of infamy, in demanding my ſiſters to deflower them, and make a prey of their chaſtities, no doubt had ſmothered my heart and ſtopped my ſences, not ſuffering me to utter one word, had not the joy which your noble vertue and valiant courage worketh in me, gotten the ſuperiority, and freed me from the exceſſive injury of ſorrow. Therefore if
<pb facs="tcp:165993:6"/> it would pleaſe the Gods to be ſo gracious unto us, that we might eſcape the imminent ruine and fall of our honour, I for my part am ready to reſign not onely my liberty, but alſo my life, and with ranſome of the cruelleſt death that man may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitate, redéem the honour of our linage and progeny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> had no ſooner declared his readineſſe in agréeing to his fathers reſolved will, but <hi>Euphilia</hi> (though by grief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to kéep ſilence) uttered forth theſe words.</p>
               <p>Father, the Tyrant can rule the body, but not the mind, he may threaten us ſhame, diſhonour, and diſgrace, but ſhall not be able to accompliſh or execute the leaſt of his menaces Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards fear the threatnings of thoſe that would flye, were they threatned: but where courage diſplayeth his Enſigns no mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may approach. And therefore let the Tyrant do what he can; for his power is not ſufficient to diſhonour our kindred by threatning us diſgrace, for that we neither fear him, nor all his torments. For death, which the Gods have appointed, a fearfull token to moſt men to warn them to leave their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and to reſign their vital breath is unto us a moſt ſwéet and pleaſant object, and yéeldeth us comfort, being the onely mean by which we may eſcape infamy and ſhame. Death therefore ſhall frée us from the Tyrants intended villany, and redéem our kindred from diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perina,</hi> glad that her ſiſter concluded ſo well to her liking, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Father, ſéeing then that (as my ſiſter hath well declared) death muſt be our redéemer, I beſéech you not to torment your old age with anxietie and grief for us; and you brother, though we die, may paſſe your youth in pleaſing reſt. And therefore let my ſiſter and me care for this matter, which toucheth us onely, and fear not that by means of our cowardiſe ye ſhall reap any diſhonour. And ſéeing that of two evils the leaſt muſt be choſen, and the greateſt avoided, let me perſwade you to look to your ſelves, and avoid the Tyrants anger, which ye are ſure to incur, if you reſiſt his will, and obey not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, accompliſhing your promiſe made unto his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<pb facs="tcp:165993:7"/> Wherefore Father ſend us, and wring your ſelf from Fortunes wrong: conſider your age, which requireth reſt: take your delight, comfort your ſelf with the preſence of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Perierio,</hi> in viewing whoſe vertues and perfections you may eaſily forget us, though we were Goodeſſes and not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal maids.

               <p>Old <hi>Camillo</hi> ſéeing that his ſon and both his daughters were endued with ſuch an haughtie and valiant mind, as a man that had forgotten all occaſion of ſorrow, with a pleaſant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance replied.</p>
               <p>Moſt haughtie <hi>Euphilia,</hi> and couyagious <hi>Perina,</hi> I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your counſels, and as you ſee put off all ſorrow: Now therefore attentively hear my counſel, and prepare your ſelves to put it in execution. My intent is ſuch, that if ye die, your brother and I will not live till morn; let us therefore diſguiſe our ſelves, and to morrow morning depart from <hi>Mantua</hi> before day. The Gods will favour us, and deliver us from <hi>Nero</hi> his hands ſéeing that we (as our conſciences witneſſe) to free their ſacred conſtitutions from violence, have left our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, lands, caſtle and ſubſtance, committing our ſelves to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes mercy, which is meer cruelty. But if our flight be ſo unhappie that we be overtaken by the Tyrant, then, as we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all to live can we all but die: and ſeeing we cannot live the one without the other, let us all live together, or all die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Theſe hoarie hairs of mine, are meſſengers of death, and warn me to prepare my ſelf for the grave: but your gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den locks, and the glory of your youth forbiddeth death to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſhall then ye be ready to die, and I that ſtand with

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Uphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina,</hi> hearing that their Father was ſo deſirous to aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don all his livings for their cauſe, fell down on their knees before his féet, and prayed him to command them to do whatſoever he pleaſed, and they would be moſt readie to execute his pleaſure. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millo</hi> therefore taking them up by the hand, willed them to prepare themſelves to depart from <hi>Mantua</hi> with him and <hi>Perierio</hi> the next morning, taking their beſt Iewels with them, and all their readie Gold. <hi>Camillo</hi> cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelf like a Shepheard, and <hi>Perierio</hi> (leſt his father ſhould be known) played the Barber, and ſhaved his beard clean off to the chin: and apparelled himſelf like a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers boy, <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina,</hi> (whoſe beauty and favour was ſuch as could not but be known) ſcarce able all night to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how they might diſguiſe themſelves in ſuch manner that they might paſſe unknown, at laſt concluded to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like Market-women, and ſéeing the wind blew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrongly, they thereby took occaſion to muffle their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their handkerchiffs, as if they had the toothach. Thus the old ſhepheard, young butcher, and muffled Market-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were ſo cunningly diſguiſed that no man thought ſo much as to dream, that they ſhould be Sir <hi>Camillo,</hi> with his ſon and his daughters. So that they paſſed not onely through the City but the Country alſo, unknown to any man. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:165993:8"/> did they reſt untill they were ſo far from <hi>Mantua</hi> that they thought themſelves to be out of danger. Yet they durſt not ſtay in any place of <hi>Italy,</hi> for fear leaſt ſearch being made after them, they might fall into the tyrants hands: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore travelled on daily till they came into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there in a ſolitary place where no kind of people but ſhepheards did reſort they built a pretty houſe, and bought a flock of ſhéep, determining to live ſhepheards untill ſuch time as the Gods and their fortune would ſuffer them to return to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſhepheards had not dwelt in their new built houſe the ſpace of ſix moneths or thereabout, but they had perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned to underſtand and ſpeak the Caſtilian tongue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the ſame language was as eaſie unto them as their own. For there being but little difference betwixt the Italian and Spaniſh tongues (which are of near affinity,) and theſe noble ſhepheards being wonderfull witty and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, it could not be but that they ſhould in ſhort ſpace apply their Italian tongue to the pronunciation of the Spaniſh words. For al the ſhepheards that in thoſe quarters dwelled, as they did marvell at the ſupernaturall beauty of theſe ſtrange ſhepheards, ſo did they think it a miracle that they had in ſo ſhort a time learned to talk with the Spaniſh ſhepheards, and that ſo eloquently and with ſuch a grace, that many took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to talk with them, and few departed from them without bearing away that which was ſufficient to inſtruct them in their own language. In ſo much that divers of them being more curious then others, when they went to talk with the new ſhepheards, carried paper books with them to note up ſuch phraſes as <hi>Perierio</hi> and his ſiſters uſed in their talk. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Caſtilian tongue, they had alſo learned to play upon all ſuch rurall and paſtorall inſtruments as were by the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of that quarter uſed. On which inſtruments <hi>Perierio</hi> played with ſuch dexterity, that the inhabitants thereabouts thought that <hi>Orpheus</hi> had been raiſed from hell to fill the air with the agréeing noiſe of his inſtrument, and to delight the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:8"/> ſhepheards of that Country with his pleaſant notes. <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina,</hi> not much inferiour unto <hi>Perierio</hi> in that quality, yet far his ſuperiours in ſinging a part in muſick, by reaſon that their voices were clearer then his, when they ſung unto their brothers inſtrument, moved the other ſhepheards to wonder at their celeſtiall melody, and become ſo hereticall, that they thought <hi>Perierio</hi> to be ſome God, and his ſiſters two Goddeſſes, ſuppoſing it a thing impoſſible that mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be indued with ſuch heavenly and immortall conditions. But whatſoever they were thought to be, they were ſo beloved of all the Spaniſh ſhepheards, that no man thought himſelf happy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had not perfect friendſhip &amp; alliance with them. Yea if the leaſt injury in the world had been offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Perierio,</hi> his aged father, or his beautifull ſiſters, they were all ready to revenge it, not as a private quarrel, but as ſome common and publick wrong done to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all the inhabitants thereof.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Camil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o,</hi> therefore ſéeing that he and his children were ſo beloved of all the Country, and taking great delight in the ſwéetneſſe of the air of that climat, began to build farms and to purchaſe land, ſo that fortune favouring him, he became in ſhort time wealthy and rich, and of great credit. <hi>Perierio</hi> his ſon, took great delight in hunting and fowling, often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his flock to his ſiſters care, who kept both his ſhéep and their own with ſuch diligence, that all men marked that they were not careleſſe, but painful and induſtrious Yea they won ſuch favour and commendation in every mans eye, as their beauty was not onely praiſed in the Country, but alſo ſpoken of in Cities farre from them. And yet was their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe modeſty ſuch, that although their praiſe dayly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet they nothing puffed up with pride, humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſcorned not to kéep company with the baſeſt ſwain in all the Country. Every day they went forth with their flocks to the field, defending their faces from the heat of the Sun, with no other ſcarf or vale then a garland made of ſundry kinds of flowers, that attire becomming them ſo
<pb facs="tcp:165993:9"/> bravely, that they ſeemed to be daughters unto the Goddeſſe <hi>Flora</hi> for their exquiſite beauty, marching with their ſhéep through the pleaſant Downs and green fields, more like to ſome heavenly Nymphs then mortall women. If it chanced there were a meeting of all the Farmers daughters, then were they (I mean <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina</hi>) bid thither as the miſtreſſes and chiefeſt of the feaſt: <hi>Perierio</hi> their brother, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe miſſed no feaſt nor game, being invited by the richeſt and chiefeſt farmers ſons; whereof many became ſutors unto his ſiſters, and many of their ſiſters enamoured of his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comely diſpoſition, wiſhed themſelves married unto him. But he delighting more in tuning his paſtorall Harp, rejoyced his companions with a round or twain, whileſt that others courted their miſtreſſes, not ſo much becauſe hee would not debaſe himſelf to love a ſhepheardeſſe, as for that he ſhunned ſo Lordly a Maſter as <hi>Cupid,</hi> eſtéeming his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedome from fancy, the onely cauſe of all his joy and pleaſure. But fortune who thitherto had favoured both <hi>Perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> and his ſiſters, began to withdraw her lovely looks from them, and in lieu of a ſmiling countenance, intended to ſhew them a lowring face and frowning forehead For not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it chanced upon a pleaſant morning betimes before <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> golden lines had gréeted the Southern plains, that <hi>Perierio</hi> haunting his accuſtomed hunt in a paſſing pleaſant wood, not far from the place where his ſiſters fed their flocks, (having left his ſhéep unto their kéeping as he was wont to do) eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a brave damoſell, her beauty being comparable to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that <hi>Venus</hi> face is dyed withall; ſitting on a hillock, and reſting her head on her hand. At the ſight whereof, <hi>Perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> greatly amazed, retired behind a buſh, where he not ſéen, might perfectly both ſée her, and hear what ſhe ſaid: for he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by her countenance that ſhe was in a melancholy mood, and vexed with extraordinary grief. Her words were theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſed with a lamentable voice, moving the very trées and buſhes to yéeld tears.</p>
               <p>Ah Fortune, as often as <hi>Phoebus</hi> appeareth in the woods,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:9"/> as often as he riſeth in his Eaſtern glory, and as often as his penetrating rayes warn me to leave my reſtleſſe reſt, and harneſſe my ſelf to my endleſſe toil, and never ceaſing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; ſo often thou doeſt renue my grief and multiply my ſorrows. What, Fortune, haſt thou made all other women ſo happy through my miſhap, that to make me an inſtance of the miſerableſt wight that liveth, thou haſt delivered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from their miſeries, to throw them all on me? O moſt injuſt doom! O moſt cruell Goddeſſe! Though by reaſon of the excéeding injuſtice, thou deſerveſt to be croſſed out of the catalogue of divine powers. And therewith ſhe roſe from the hillock, and looking round about which way ſhe might take, ſhe eſpied <hi>Perierio</hi> behind the buſh coming towards her, which ſhe marking, ſtaied unill he came near her and ſaluting him with a moſt gratious countenance, ſaid. Shepheard (for ſo much thy apparell betokeneth, though thy beauty be ſuch, as maketh me to miſtruſt if, and think that thou art but a counterfeit ſhepheard) pardon me if I be too bold in deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy name and country; which if it may pleaſe thee to tell me, thou ſhalt bind me to owe thee a good turn. <hi>Perierio</hi> (whoſe heart was pierced with <hi>Cupids</hi> ſhaft, and on ſuddain made captive to that Lord whoſe ſervice he ſo ſhunned) ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on this Lady (for ſhe was no leſſe, as you ſhall hereafter learn) in whoſe beauty all his deſire reſted that he could ſcarce ſpeak one word; at laſt, plucking up his ſpirits, anſwered. Madam (for your exquiſite perfections and ſtately countenance deſerves no leſſe) where no offence is committed, pardon is craved but in vain; I am an Italian born; called <hi>Perierio,</hi> the happieſt man that ever was named, if occaſion were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented wherein I might do any ſervice acceptable vnto you Madam, I thank thée <hi>Perierio</hi> (replied the young Lady) for this thy undeſerved curteſie; and ſeeing I am not able at this time to make thee any recompence. I can but pray the Gods to grant thee thy hearts deſire. And with that ſhooting into the midſt of the woods ſhe was out of <hi>Perierios</hi> ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought ſhe was departed. For when ſhe heard by his
<pb facs="tcp:165993:10"/> name and Country, that he was not the man ſhe doubted of, and gathering by his countenance, that he was ſuddenly ſtrook in love of her, leaſt he ſhould become troubleſome and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate unto her, haſted thence, ſuppoſing that ſhe being out of ſight ſhould alſo be out of the ſhepheards mind; and that by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But alaſſe, where ſhe thought by her departure to eaſe his grief contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe increaſed his paſſions. For he ſéeing that the ſum of his conceived pleaſures were fled, and ſhe miſſing, in whoſe gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den locks his ſoul was intangled, began to cry out with a loud and pittyfull voyce. My ſoul, my ſoul, whither art thou fled? Why haſt thou left my body, ſéeing that thou being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from me, I may not live? Ah poor <hi>Perierio</hi> wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perierio!</hi> Die: die miſerable <hi>Perierio.</hi> Ah cruell Gods, that have alotted me a life worſe than death and a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoul.

Is this the thankfulneſſe you talked of Is this the good turn you ſhould owe me? To ſteal away my heart, and carry my ſoul with thee, impriſoned in the ſnares of thy alluring looks; leaving my body breathleſſe, and ſo giving me ſufficient occaſion to accuſe them both of theft and murther, conſidering that thou haſt robbed me of my ſoul, and thereby deprived me of life. For now have I no life of mine own but live onely in thée Ah unhappy man that live, and know not where I live, for I live in that body which is in place as far unknown unto me, as that body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Forgive me <hi>Cupid</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and mighty God, I confeſſe to have offended in contemning and neglecting thy puiſſance: Which my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, thou haſt puniſhed with a pain the like never heard of before. The dart penetrated into the very inmoſt part of my heart and forced me to yéeld to love. Séeing then I love and am inroled in the ſcrowl of thoſe that follow thy bands, as a
<pb facs="tcp:165993:10"/> true and valerous Captain lead me to the knowledge of that which I love. For I doubt nut but that thou which haſt had the puiſſance to make me love, and that ſo ſtrangely; art like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe able to make me know whom I love. Thus <hi>Perierio</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had with many ſighs and tears bewailed the loſſe of his former fréedome, began at length to conſider, that the accuſtomed hour of his returning to dinner was paſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaſt his father ſhould marvell at his long abſence, and by reaſon thereof fall into ſuſpition, leaſt ſome miſchance had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him (for old men are always carefull of their children, and as often as they be out of ſight, ſo often do they déem them to be loſt) he more like a ſhadow then a man croſſed the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way homewards. Where he found his aged father ſléeping, for the heavineſſe he was in by reaſon of <hi>Perierios</hi> abſence, rocked him a ſleep: but as ſoon as he heard <hi>Perierio,</hi> he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and then they fell cloſely to their chear, though <hi>Perierios</hi> mind ran more on his unknown miſtreſſe then his preſent meat.</p>

               <p>What an excellent matter is it (ſaid <hi>Euphilia</hi>) ſiſter <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> that we here leading this Country life, and being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the noiſe and tempeſtuous uproars and broyls which commonly are raiſed in the proud Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould injoy ſuch extream pleaſure as we do in theſe pleaſant groves, ſometimes being in the ſhadow, ſometimes ſitting on the banks of the delectable River, and ſometimes walking in the dark groves, where we both fence our faces from <hi>Phoebus</hi> injury, and delight our ears with the naturall Muſick of the ſinging birds. I promiſe you truly (quoth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:165993:11"/> I am of opinion that the noiſe which the wind maketh among the trées, doth delight and recreate the hearts of men, more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fond noiſe of ſome people when there is a great aſſembly. For there the greateſt pleaſure, is meer grief: proud Majeſty and highneſſe, nothing elſe but vanity; feaſts and games nothing but troubles and tempeſts; honour and renown, nothing but blind errours; and moſt commonly we find, that among them that delight in that kind of life, words and thoughts are different, the tongue pronouncing otherwiſe then the heart meaneth. But here (ſaid <hi>Euphilia</hi>) ambition layeth not her bait, neither hath avarice or covetouſneſſe any place here. The people doth not here aſpire to honours nor ſue for dignities: but men live free from paſſions and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in al virtue and ſimplicity. Here reigneth little or no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but all things are ruled by juſtice. Neither doth the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhepheard (quoth <hi>Perina</hi>) ſéek out new parts of the world nor adventure into ſtrange Countries, committing himſelf neither to the cruell furious winds, nor unmercifull waves, to enlarge his treaſure, or augment his riches. And yet he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as contentedly with that little which he hath, as he that doth abound in rich poſſeſſions and great revenues.</p>

               <p>Ah love, thou canſt not invent any worſe torment then I feel nor thou fortune canſt be more variable and inconſtant,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:12"/> then thou art unto me.

In ſo much that all theſe things cauſed him to think that he had received ſome ſolace, though the importance of that which he ſought, and the deſire he had to find the ſame, gave him no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to reſt in that place. Yet was he, being a ſtranger ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly entertained by the two ſiſters, that he deemed himſelf not a little happy to have lighted on ſuch company, Wherefore he being intreated by them to go with them to their lodging, to eat ſomething, and to refreſh himſelf with ſuch dainties as their country manner afforded, could not but grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſo followed them unto their fathers houſe. Where he was received of aged <hi>Camillo</hi> and his ſon, not as a ſtranger, but as one that had been of their near kindred and affinity. For they marking his ſingular beauty and perfection of body his excellent grace in ſpeaking, his ſharp wit; and his comely, behaviour, thought him worthy of all the curteſie they could i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine to ſhew him. Supper being done, old <hi>Camillo</hi> took his leave of the ſtrange ſhepheard, and went to his reſt. But <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erio</hi> and his ſiſters keeping the ſhepheard company, led him into the Orchard to take the evening air, after that <hi>Phoebus</hi> had ſhut up his light in the Weſtern parts.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:12"/> to know what ſiniſter chance had brought the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard into ſuch a Chaos of cares and world of ſorrows, began thus to be inquiſitive of his fortune.</p>
               <p>Gentle ſhepheard, ſéeing that the night is no time to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and you are ſo tired that you are like to fall in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſome ſore diſeaſe, unleſſe you look to your ſelf and reſt your weary limbs, I heartily pray y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> to ſtay with us this night, and you ſhall have no worſe bed then where my brother lieth on, nor worſe bed-fellow then himſelf. And for as much as the pleaſantneſſe of this cool air is ſuch, that it inticeth and provoketh us to recreate our ſelves therein: if that you will whileſt we expect the coming of the dark night, unfold the cauſe of this your wandring journey unto us, and make us pertakers of your evill and adverſe fortune, we ſhall think us to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholding unto you. The ſhepheard would not be long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by ſuch excellent perſons, but walking with them in a pleaſant arbour of Eglentine, began to diſcourſe after this manner.</p>
               <p>Gentle ſhepheards, the manifold benefits which it hath pleaſed you to heap on me being a meer ſtranger, unworthy by my deſerts of the leaſt courteſie in the world, bind me to yéeld to whatſoever you can demand of me, as far as my ſimple power ſtretcheth, And therefore although my evill be of ſuch nature that it cannot be communicated unto all kinds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet the opinion which I conceive of your deſerts, and the valor which your beauty bewrayeth, conſtraineth me to make an open rehearſall of all my forepaſt life, if I may term that life which I would willingly counterpoiſe and change with death.

And it was amongſt us agreed, that our wedding ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:165993:14"/> be kept in the City of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> to the end the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> might be preſent at the ſame. Whereupon we diſpatched a Poſt in all haſte to advertiſe the King of this marriage, &amp; to intreat his Majeſty that we commending our charge unto faithfull and truſty perſons, might come thither to celebrate our mariage the. The rumor of which marriage was inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſperad through all the City and the neighbour places thereof and cauſed ſuch a general joy and applauſe in all men, as ſo beautifull a Lady as <hi>Alcida,</hi> and ſo faithfull a lover as my ſelf deſerved. Vntill that time it ſéemeth that I was very happy. But fortune that favoured me ſo highly, afterward caſt me down headlong into the depth of theſe miſeries, in which I find my ſelf preſently, Know therefore that after my unfortunate marriage was concluded on, and the Kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe granted, <hi>Eugerio</hi> being a widower, his ſon <hi>Polidor,</hi> his daughters <hi>Alcida</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> and unhappy <hi>Marcelio,</hi> who unfoldeth his miſhap unto you, having committed our charge to loyall perſons, we embarked at the Haven of <hi>Centa,</hi> to ſail to the noble City of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> there to celebrate our marriage, as I have before ſaid. The content and pleaſure which we conceived of our wiſhed deſires, in ſuch manner blinded us, that regarding neither the unmercifull waves nor the boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winds, and commending our veſſel to fortune, the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of inconſtancy, we went to ſea in the worſt and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt time of the year, not conſidering or perpending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that at ſuch times are ordinary. But very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereafter, fortune chaſtiſed our temerity and fond raſhne: for before night had covered <hi>Neptunes</hi> face with the curtain of darkneſſe, the Maſter of the ſhip diſcovered certain tokens of tempeſts to come. Soon after began the thick and obſcure clouds to cover the skies, the angry waves began to murmur, the winds blow variably. Whereupon the maſter of the ſhip with a fearful and troubled countenance uttered theſe words. Ah ſorrowfull and fearfull tokens! Ah infortunate bark! What ill luck and miſerable adventure is prepared for thée, if the Gods here ſhew not their deity!</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:14"/>
               <p>He had no ſooner ended theſe words, but a certain boiſtreus and furious blaſt ſo launced on the mainſail, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whirled into the body of the whole ſhip, that at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe was in ſuch danger, that he who held the ſtern was forced to abandon the government thereof, and ſo the ſhip fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the mighty fury wherewith ſhe was led, &amp; went whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wind and waves did drive her. The tempeſt increaſed more and more and became greater and greater; the furious waves covered with white fome began to augment their anger and to rage more then before. There might we ſée a maſſie rain falling from the element, intermingled with lightening and fearfull thunder. There might we alſo hear a terrible noiſe and ſhaking of the ſail yard, the maſt, the lines, cords, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and tackling of the ſhip. There might we alſo hear the lamentable voice both of the paſſengers and Mariners, which cauſed us to fear excéedingly. The winds beſet the ſhip on all ſides, and the waves battered it in ſuch manner, that the very ſtrongeſt and beſt nailed parts thereof burſt in pieces. The proud ſea ſometimes lifted us up to the firmament, and ſuddenly ſhe carried us down even unto the bottome; yea and (that which was wonderfull) the waves in ſuch manner parted aſunder, that we might plainly ſée the ſand &amp; gravel in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ſea. The men and women that were in the ſhip la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and bewailing their infortunate end, ſome fetched heavy and grievous ſighs from the bottome of their hearts; ſome offered pittifull vows, others yéelded fountains of tears out of their eys. The maſter of the ſhip not knowing what to do againſt ſuch raging fortune, his cunning being overcome by the fierceneſſe and perſeverance of the tempeſt, could no longer <hi>conduire le timon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knew not the nature nor off-ſpring of the winds, and in one inſtant commanded and ordained a thouſand different matters. The Mariners troubled and vexed by reaſon of the agony and perplexity of their preſent death, could not execute their charge and by reaſon of the noiſe and cries of the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, could not underſtand what the maſter preſcribed them,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:15"/> calling as loud as he could for his life. Some of them turned the ſail yard; others hales the ſale cord; others ſtriked the top-ſail; others came to mend the ſprit ſail; others to ſave the miſen ſail; others did take of the bonnet and inlargement of the main-ſail; others were occupied with knitting the broken liues together; others looked to the hinder deck tail and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the ſhip; others to the fore deck; others to the hatches; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voided the ſea into the ſea, caſting the water out of the ſhip. To be ſhort every man did what in him lay to defend and ſave the miſerable veſſel from inevitable ſhipwrack. But all their diligence ſerved to no end, their vows and tears helped not to appeaſe angry and fierce <hi>Neptune;</hi> but the night approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched more and more, and the wind and tempeſt increaſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly.

               <p>Comfort your ſelves my children, arm your hearts with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, leave all grief and ſorrow unto me, to the end that I dying may ſuffer as many deaths as ye all muſt endure.</p>
               <p>This, old <hi>Eugerio</hi> uttered with ſo many ſighs and ſobs that he could ſcarce with much ado ſpeak, embracing us all one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another to take his leave and bid us farewell, before the hour of eminent ſhipwrack was come. It would be a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and difficult matter for me preſently to recount what tears <hi>Aloda</hi> wept, and what grief I ſuffered for her ſake, and therefore I will onely tell you one thing that nothing ſo much grieved me as that my life (which I had offered for her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) could not take end without her death. In the mean time our forlorn ſhip driven with the force of the angry waves and furious winds (which blew ſo marvellous ſtrongly) flying all night though the ſtreight of <hi>Gilbatan,</hi> more ſwiftly then we wiſhed or ſerved our turn the next day went aſtray, I know not how many leagues into the large <hi>Mediterrean</hi> ſea.</p>
               <p>Where after that we had long wandred hither and thither, the force of the wind and waves driving us up and down for the ſpace of that dry and night, the next morning the tempeſt ſéemed to be ſomething aſſwaged, and the rufull waves aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their courage, <hi>Neptune</hi> ſpread a pleaſant calm over the ſea; wherewith we were not a little cheared.</p>
               <p>But fortune not contented to have heaped ſuch a world of calamities upon us, would alſo take her pleaſure in mocking us in the midſt of miſeries. For on the ſuddain the wiſhed calm was turned into a worſe and greater extream tempeſt then before: which brought us into ſuch extreamity, that we hoped not for one hour of life. At laſt one ſide of the ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrooken with a great raging whirlwind, the other ſide lay
<pb facs="tcp:165993:16"/> flat upon the water, and was in danger to ſink preſently.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw the manifeſt danger, I began to ungird my ſword, to the end it might not hinder me, and imbracing <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> I leaped with her into the ſhip boat. <hi>Clenarde</hi> being a light and nimble Gentlewoman, following us did the ſame, not leaving behind her bow and arrows, for that ſhe eſtéemed more of that than of ſome great and precious treaſure. <hi>Polidor</hi> thruſting his father forwards, thought to have done as much, and to have leaped into the boat as we had done; but the ſhip-Maſter, with another Marriner, leaped in before them: And as <hi>Polidor</hi> with his aged father thought to have followed, the boat was ſeparated from the ſhip by reaſon of a mighty wave which was driven by the wind betwixt the ſhip and the boat, ſo that they were forced to remain in the ſhip: the ſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in ſhort time we loſt, and never ſince heard any news of her. But I am of opinion, that (all doubt removed) ſhe was ſwallowed up by <hi>Neptunes</hi> greedy waves, or that croſſing overthwart the Sea, ſhe periſhed miſerably on the coaſt of <hi>Spain.</hi>

This notwithſtanding the morning next following, we perceived that we were very near to land, endeavouring to row as near it as we could poſſibly, At the length, the two Marriners being very cunning in ſwimming, did not onely
<pb facs="tcp:165993:16"/> leap into the water to ſwim to the ſhore, but alſo drew us all to that ſo long deſired land. After we were ſo happily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the danger which furious <hi>Neptune</hi> threatned us. the Marriners faſtened their ſhip-boat to the ſhore ſide, and knowing the place where we landed, told us we were in the Iſle of Formentera: and wonderfully marvelled that we had run ſo many miles in ſo little time. But they had ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the wonders that fierce tempeſts are accuſtomed to do. that they were not too much amazed at the courſe of our navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Yet howſoever the tempeſt had driven us, we were then aſſured and out of danger of the menaces wherewith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune feared us amidſt the inexorable waves. But we were ſo gréeved for the loſſe of <hi>Eugerio</hi> and <hi>Polydor,</hi> ſo troubled with wearineſſe, and ſo famiſhed with hunger, that we had none or little cauſe to rejoice of the life which we had recovered. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I now rehearſe what tears <hi>Alcida</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> ſhed becauſe they had loſt their father and brother, to the end that I may tell you the ſorrowful and unhappy ſucceſſe, which I had in that deſart and ſolitary Iſle. For after that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we were arrived in the ſame, I was delivered from the fury of the ſea, love became ſuch an adverſary and enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that he ſéemed to be grieved that my life was ſaved from the pecil of the tempeſt, and that he would torment me with a new and more grievous pain, when I thought my ſelf to be in ſafety. For malicious <hi>Cupid</hi> wounded the heart of the Pylot (who was called <hi>Bartophamus</hi>) and rendred him ſo far in love of the beauty of <hi>Clenarde,</hi> the ſiſter to <hi>Alcida,</hi> that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the point of his intended deſires, he forgot the law of friendſhip and fidelity, and imagined a ſtrange and wicked treaſon which he did put in execution. Which was ſuch.</p>
               <p>As the two ſiſters wept, and grievouſly lamented their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and brothers miſerable death, it happened that <hi>Alcida</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with heavineſſe and wearineſſe, ſhe lay down on the ſand and fell a ſléep. Whereupon I began to ſay to the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot: friend <hi>Bartophamus</hi> if we take not ſome order to provide for victuals, and if our ill luck be ſuch that we can find
<pb facs="tcp:165993:17"/> none, we may make account we have not ſaved our lives, but rather that we have changed the manner and kind of our death: and therefore would I that you and your companion ſhould go to ſome village or burrough of this Iſle, which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> may find, to fetch meat for us to eat. Sir <hi>Marcelio</hi> (anſwered <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phamus</hi>) fortune hath done us pleaſure enough in bringing us hither, and helping us to arrive at this Iſle, though it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart and barren. And you muſt not think that we ſhall here find any meat to aſſwage our hunger, and remedy our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the country is not inhabited. But I will tell you how we may find means to ſuffer no hunger: do you ſée yonder lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Iſle that lieth right over againſt us, in that Iſle there is great quantity of Dear, Conies, Hares, and many other beaſts. There is alſo a Hermitage, where the Hermite hath good ſtore of bread and meal. Therefore I am of this advice, that it were good that <hi>Clenarde</hi> (whoſe dexterity and cunning in ſhooting is not unknown unto you) ſhould paſſe over to that Iſle and carry her bow and arrows, which ſhe hath here with her, &amp; kill ſome Hart or Doe. I and my companion will row her thither, and you ſir <hi>Marcelio</hi> may ſtay with <hi>Alcida.</hi> For it may ſo come to paſſe, that before ſhe awaketh, we ſhall return hither with abundance of freſh and ſavoury proviſion. This counſell of the Pylot was well liked of me, and <hi>Clenar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> we not thinking of his pretended treaſon. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Clenarde,</hi> would not in any caſe paſſe over to the ſaid Iſle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I went with her; for ſhe durſt not truſt the Mariners. And although I excuſed my ſelf not to go with her, ſaying that it was not convenient for me to leave <hi>Alcida</hi> alone, and that ſléeping in a place ſo ſolitary; ſhe anſwered, that the diſtance betwéen that place and the little Iſle, was not very great, that ſhe was ſure that we ſhould bring good proviſion with us, for that there was much veniſon in the Iſle, and that the ſea was calm and ſtill, (for after that we were ſet on ſhore the ſurging waves were appeaſed) by reaſon whereof ſhe concluded, that we might paſſe over to the Iſle, and return again before <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida</hi> awaked, eſpecially becauſe ſhe was tired with wearineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:17"/> and had many nights béen deprived of her reſt. Finally, ſhe alledged ſo many reaſons, that forgetting what was moſt convenient for me to do, I reſolved to accompany her to the Iſle. Whereof <hi>Battophamus</hi> was not a little grieved, for that he ſought not to have any but <hi>Clenarde</hi> onely to go, to the end that he might the better execute his villainous treaſon, yet wanted not the villain means to bring his wicked will to paſſe: for we leaving <hi>Alcida</hi> a ſléep alone and being all ſetled in the boat to paſſe to the Iſle, I thinking of no hurt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unarmed (for I left all my weapons in the ſhip when I leaped into the boat with <hi>Alcida</hi> to ſavo our lives) the two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners fell upon me, took me and bound me,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clenarde</hi> ſéeing their manifeſt treaſon, would for grief caſt her ſelf overboard into the ſea, but the Pylot held her, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her aſide, ſecretly ſaid unto her in this manner. Lady, trouble not your ſelf for this fact, and be not grieved at that which you ſee us do; we do it in your behalf you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this <hi>Marcelio</hi> aſſoon as we were arrived in yonder deſart Iſle, ſpake ſecretly unto me, and deſired me to counſell you to paſſe over to the Iſle hard by, and after that we were on the ſea, that I ſhould ſail Eaſtward, declaring that he was in love with you, and that he would leave your ſiſter in the Iſle, to the end that he might have you at his pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or hinderance. And whereas he made ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and ſéemed ſo unwilling to accompany you, he did but diſſemble to cloak his malice, But I beholding the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your paſſing beauty, not to prejudice your deſerts, at the very hour that I ſhould have executed the treaſon, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to remain loyal and faithfull unto you, and thereupon have ſerved <hi>Marcelio</hi> as you ſee, with full deliberation to leave him at the end of an Iſle not far hence, on the ſhore ſide, and thence to return with you incontinently to the place where we left your ſiſter ſleeping. Now you know how the matter ſtandeth, and therefore ſee what you will do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clenarde</hi> hearing this in good ſooth beleeved that it was all true, and was mortally angry with me, being very well
<pb facs="tcp:165993:18"/> content that <hi>Bartophamus</hi> ſhould carry me to that place where he had appointed to leave me. Beſides, ſhe beheld me with a diſdainful countenance, that I could not enough marvel at the ſtrangeneſſe of her alteration. And ſhe was ſo inraged that ſhe could not ſpeak, but ſhe rejoyced in her heart, that ſhe ſhould be ſo revenged of me; without perceiving the knavery which the Pylot went about. So that I well marked, that <hi>Clenarde</hi> was nothing grieved at my evill intreatment, whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at the firſt, ſhe took it ſo heavily: and therefore I ſaid unto her, How now my ſiſter, what mean you by this? Do you think both my miſfortune and yours, and the danger wherein the Gods have placed us both at this inſtant, to be ſo ſmall and of ſo little weight, that you ought ſo ſoon to ceaſe from wéeping? Or do you hope to ſee us ſoon delivered out of their traiterous hands, that we may be revenged of their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany. Whereupon ſhe inflamed with fury, like a fierce Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſſe, told me, that I was ſo dealt withall, becauſe I would have left her ſiſter <hi>Alcida</hi> in the ſolitary iſle to lead her away, and many other ſuch brave invented lies, which the Pylot had made her to beleeve.</p>
               <p>When I underſtood that, I felt ſuch an extream pain, and was ſo greeved, that I well perceived, that never the like had befallen me before; and although I could not ſtir nor touch thoſe Peaſants, yet I miſcalled them, and railed at them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.</p>
               <p>And as touching <hi>Clenarde,</hi> I alledged her ſuch quick and forcible reaſons, that at length ſhe knew that all this procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the love which the Pylot <hi>Bartophamus</hi> bore her. So that ſhe began ſo pittyfully to lament our caſe, that it was ſufficient to mollifie ſtones, but not the hard hearts of thoſe traiterous mariners. Now conſider, that our boat had in ſhort time with marvellous ſwiftneſſe overrun a great part of the ſea, when as unfortunate <hi>Alcida</hi> awaked, and found her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who ſeeing that ſhe was to abandoned and forſaken, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her eys toward the ſea ſide, to ſee if the could eſpy the boat and perceiving that it was not there, ſhe went along the ſhore
<pb facs="tcp:165993:18"/> to ſeek us, but ſhe found no body. Ye may well think beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhepheards) what grief <hi>Alcida</hi> ſuffered at that inſtant, and imagine what abundance of tears ſhe ſent from her Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal eyes. Conſider I pray you, in what extremity the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable young Lady found her ſelf, when as ſhe was left all alone in that ſolitary and deſart Iſle: perpend in like manner how often ſhe meant violently to caſt her ſelf down headlong into the ſea, moleſting the air with her lamenting voice, and how often ſhe called me, and forced eccho to repeat my name in the element. But we were by this time ſo far ſeparated from her, that we could not underſtand her cries, but we might well perceive that ſhe with a white handkerchiff (which ſhe lifted in the air) made ſign that we ſhould return, but the traitor <hi>Bartophamus</hi> could not be intreated. But ſailing marvellous ſwiftly with wind and tide, wee arrived at the Iſle Iuique, where he landed and with his companion carried me on the ſhore, tying me to an ancker that ſtuck in the ground. Incontinently certain Mariners came thither being of <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phamus</hi> acquaintance and of like diſpoſition. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Clenarde</hi> recommended her honour unto them, &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to deliver her from <hi>Bartophamus</hi> his wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, yet ſhe obteined nothing the more of them peaſants, who took no regard of her juſt complaint, but gave the traitor ſufficient proviſion to live, wherewith he entered his boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, taking <hi>Clenarde</hi> with him ſorely againſt her will. After which time I have not ſeen her, nor heard any news of her. I remained there a long time famiſhed and bound hand and foot. But the chiefeſt part of my grief conſiſted in the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and miſerable caſe which poor <hi>Alcida</hi> was in, being left alone in the Iſle of Formentera. For as concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity wherein I was, that was ſoon redreſſed. For certain mariners that were more pittyfull and honeſter men then the other villains, hearing me call unto them, came near me, and freed me from my wonderfull kind of priſon unloſing the lines wherewith I was tied to the anchor. And after that they had given me meat to aſſwage the fury of hunger (which well
<pb facs="tcp:165993:19"/> near had overcome me and cauſed me to reſign my life) I was ſo earneſt wtth them, and ſo importunately requeſted them to carry me to the Iſle of Formenters, that they being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with pity preſently rigged a briggantine, and making proviſion of victuals and weapons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ailed with me to the Iſle of Formentera, where I had left <hi>Alcida.</hi> But what ſearch I made I could not find her. Suppoſe gentle ſhepheards that ſhe had choſen the ſea to be the ſepulcher wherein ſhe buried her grieved body, or that the wild and ſavage beaſts had made a prey of her tender limbs. But I ſearching along the ſhore, plains, rocks, valleys, caves dens, and moſt ſecret corners, and burroughs, of all the Iſle, at length found a piece of a rock wherein certain letters were ingraved with the point of a knife, which conteined this proteſtation; which I as déeply ingraved in my heart with the edge of my memory, as it was cut in the hard rock with the point of a knife.</p>

Wherefore being invironed with ſo many calamities and troubles, I as weary to live any longer, would have pierced my diſtreſſed heart, intending to run on the point of my ſword had not thoſe good Mariners that were with me, not onely by perſwaſions and words, but in effect and deeds alſo hindred my intent. They forced me half dead to return to the Brigantine, and by my importunate intreaties they ſailed towards the coaſts of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, and landed at the Haven of Cayetta in the Kingdome of Naples: wherein I enquired for <hi>Alcida,</hi> asking news of all thoſe that I found; and at length meeting with certain ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, after I had told them certain tokens of her, they knowing whom I meant, informed me that ſhe certainly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the ſame Haven in a Spaniſh ſhip, which paſſing by the Iſle of Formentera, and them rivers, finding her there all alone, fetched her aboard. And that becauſe I ſhould not find her, ſhe had changed her apparel and clothed her ſelf like a ſhepheard. Whereupon I alſo became a ſhepheard to the eye, in outward colours, hoping the ſooner to find her; and in this habit ran over the whole Country: without méeting with any man that might tell me news of her. At length I found a certain ſhepheard that gave me intelligence, that ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was informed of her being there, took ſhip and ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into Spain. So that with all ſpeed I took ſhip alſo, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to follow her, and I arrived here in Spain which I have almoſt courſed over, and as yet I cannot hear any tidings of this cruell Lady, which I ſeek with ſuch labour and exceeding pain.</p>

               <p>After he had ended this Sonnet, <hi>Perina</hi> his youngeſt ſiſter, ſéeing that he aroſe to depart thence, whiſtled and ſo ſtaied him. For he marvelled who it ſhould be; but at length eſpied both his ſiſters coming towards him, which wonderfully aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him, becauſe they had never done the like before; and curteouſly greeting them, asked what the cauſe was of their coming thither? <hi>Euphilia</hi> anſwered, your ſelf brother <hi>Perierio.</hi> For though we have great regard of our own welfare (quoth <hi>Perina</hi>) yet we do not regard our ſelves onely, but are as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your fortune as of our own. And therefore we (quoth <hi>Euphilia</hi>) marking and perceiving by your ſolitary walks, that you were troubled with ſome grief or other, and that ſome misfortune had happened unto you, we were as ſorry as if it had béen our own caſe. This brother <hi>Perierio,</hi> is the cauſe of our coming, to ſee if we might come in knowledge of the evill which tormenteth your youth, that it being known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, might by our diligence and induſtry, be remedied and amended. Therefore brother conceal it not from us whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, and you ſhall find in us more then ſiſter-like readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if more may be. Ah loving ſiſters (quoth <hi>Perierio</hi>) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enough thank you both, for the love you bear me; and in truth the onely cauſe that I have ſmothered my pain with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, not detecting it unto any of you, hath been, for that <hi>I</hi> was loath that you ſhould be grieved for my ſake, and <hi>I</hi> wiſhed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much: as that al the diſcontent and anguiſh of my evil ſhould redound to no bodies grief but mine own. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſweet ſiſters) if you love your ſelves and me alſo wiſh not to be acquainted with my ſore, leaſt you ſuffer part of the pain. But content your ſelves, and look to the tranquility of your own hearts, not tormenting your ſelves in my behalf. But you be deceived herein brother <hi>Perierio</hi> (quoth <hi>Euphilia.</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:165993:23"/> For in thinking to free us from grief by concealing your evil you do amiſſe. Know you not that they which are carefull of any mans welfare, and ſo tenderly love him, that they think themſelves hurt if any ill light on him, are continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with fear if he be grieved, thinking the cauſe thereof of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to be far greater or worſe then it is?</p>
               <q>Quando ego non in tui graviora pericula veris?</q>
               <p>And therefore brother you afflict our hearts with divers torments in concealing your evill from us, whereas we can but feel one pain if we knew it. For now the torment of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition in ſuſpecting divers things, doth aſſail us of one ſide, fearing ſometimes one miſchief ſometimes another; every one whereof woundeth our hearts with paſſing ſorrow. And fear maketh the aſſault of the other ſide; cauſing us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the matter is far worſe then it is. Laſtly, hope trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us as much as ſuſpicion or fear. For though it be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind of future luck or good to come, and not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; yet is it but a perturbation of the mind troubling and vexing it continually; and he that hopeth enjoyeth not his hearts eaſe nor quietneſſe of mind. Why then ſiſter (quoth <hi>Perierio</hi>) to rid you of all ſuſpicion, fear and hope, know that I love, and ſuſpect no worſe, nor hope any better; and ask we no more, for I ſhould not be able to anſwer you if you ſhould be too inquiſitive. The reaſon is becauſe I know not whom I love; nor where ſhe is whom I love. And is it love (quoth <hi>Perina</hi>) that troubleth you? Why then left you not this verſe out of the Sonnet, which you ſung to the Cytharen but even now.</p>

What think you not that vertue, nobility, excellency, or wealth, may move us to love? Then you muſt confeſſe that I may love, and yet not allured by <hi>Venus</hi> colours. Nevertheleſſe know, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the onely cauſe and motive of my love, and yet do I not think that the verſe which my ſiſter <hi>Perina</hi> ſo well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, was unfitly inſerted among the other verſes of my Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. For ſéeing that I loved, and yet was bereft of all hope, ever to injoy her whom I loved (becauſe I neither knew what ſhe was, nor where ſhe was, as I have already told you) by reaſon whereof, I wiſhed no greater pleaſure then grief, nor better companion then wo, and therefore might very well ſay, that the unſure looks of <hi>Venus</hi> ſhould not provoke my pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive thoughts from we to wantonneſſe; meaning not by <hi>Venus</hi> looks ſincere and true love, but wanton and voluptuous love.</p>

               <p>And for as much as we are far from any town or village, if it will pleaſe you to take in good part ſuch homely fare as my fathers country cottage can afford, you ſhall find us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lead you thither, and to welcome you to ſuch chear, as may content nature, though it be not comparable to courtly dainties. The Knight being very weary, and fearing leaſt he might incur extream danger, if it ſhould happen to be long are he might reach to ſome town, though he was aſhamed, neceſſity forcing him thereto, accepted of <hi>Euphilias</hi> offer; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that God had ſent him in that wood to méet with thoſe curteous ſhepheards, who beyond all expectation proffered him ſuch friendſhip and ſuccour, he being a meer ſtranger unto them. Therefore thanking them for their excéeding curteſie, he did bear them company to their fathers houſe. Where the old man, rejoycing to ſee ſo comely a perſon by his ſon <hi>Perierio</hi> and his two daughters feaſted the Knight in ſuch manner, that he eaſily might perceive that he was welcome. After they had ended dinner, <hi>Euphilia</hi> asked the Knight how he had gotten all thoſe wounds, and what ill fortune had brought him into ſuch danger. Whereupon the Knight began to make this diſcourſe of his tragedy. Gentle ſhepheards, to the end that
<pb facs="tcp:165993:25"/> you may know that you have the miſerableſt man in the world before your eyes, here preſent with you, I will as briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare you the hiſtory of all my life as I may, ſo I be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome unto you, to hear the tragicall events happened unto me ſince my cradle, I am loath to give you any cauſe of grief.

But no; fortune would reſerve me to worſer events, and I was not ſo happy to be dealt withall as my unkind couſin had appointed. For the midwife being pricked with remorſe of conſcience, and overcome with pity, could not find in her heart to ſtifle me in her hands, when as I was committed to her to be tenderly handled and looked to, with all the care and diligence that might be; but ſhe invented another manner to content <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtro,</hi> (for ſo was my couſin named) which was ſecretly to ſteal me from my parents, and to convey me into the houſe of a poor labouring man (whoſe wife was wont to ſerve for nurſe unto ſuch poor mens wives as for weakneſſe or ſickneſſe could not bring up their own children) about twenty miles from the place where my parents dwelled, which was the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned City of Conſtantinople my father at that time being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall governour over the ſame City.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:26"/> midwife, could find neither father nor mother, after the ſame midwife was dead, began to calculate the time of my birth, and finding it to be full juſt at the time that the nurſe avouched that I was brought unto her, remembred that the midwife had told him, that ſhe had diſpatched the child, &amp; taken ſuch order that he ſhould never be heard of. And therefore he never thought any otherwiſe but that I was dead. But after he had heard this rumor ſpread through the City of me, he began to think how women are pittyfull, &amp; therefore doubted whether the midwife had cauſed me to be foſtred or no in that place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould not hear of me; he conſidered alſo, that my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had told him divers times, that I was not dead but loſt, or rather ſtoln: though in truth they thought I was dead, and imagined that the midwife had but made them to underſtand that I was loſt, or ſtoln to diminiſh their grief with hope. He conſidered alſo, that the midwife was no woman to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the child her ſelf-ſéeing that ſhe had béen widow a long time, and was above 70 years old when ſhe died, which age was not convenient for wantonneſſe, to be ſhort, he concluded that it was I, and fearing leſt if the nurſe ſhould make too dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch to find out my parents, it might at length come to my fathers ear, and himſelf thereby deprived of his heredity, he cauſed the nurſe to come unto him and told her, that ſéeing no man would father me he would have me brought up to be his page, ſéeing that I was a pretty fair complexioned boy. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing with her for my board, charged her to let me want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to uſe me well. After that time he came oftentimes to the place where the nurſe dwelt, to ſée whether I was wel handled, and ſent me apparel by his men, and money to diſcharge my expences for my board. When I was about ten or eleven years of age, he took me from that place and made me his page, but in truth he uſed me as if I had béen his brother rather then his boy: by reaſon whereof my father, (though I then did not yet know that he was my father) made the more of me: for my couſin dwelled with my father, and was as his ſon. In the mean time I thought my ſelf moſt
<pb facs="tcp:165993:26"/> happy, ſéeing that I had no father to have hit upon ſo good a maſter, Whom I ſerved as faithfully as he dearly loved me. After I had ſerved him the ſpace of thrée or four years, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by adoption and my father by right, though fortune had beguiled nature, died, and my mother within thrée moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his burial. So that my maſter being in poſſeſſion of all my fathers goods, lands, and lordſhips, began to Court all the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt gentlewomen of the city, thinking himſelf worthy to be matched with the chiefeſt. Among all others unto whom he made love, he chiefly offered his ſervice to the daughter of a Spaniſh Knight that lived in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> called <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco de guerdona,</hi> a man of great valour, wealth, and policy. So that my maſter to obtein the love of fair <hi>Eleonora</hi> (for ſo was the gentlewoman called) ſued ſought, watched, warded, praied, proteſted, and did what ſervice a man might be ſaid to do in the behalf of his miſtreſſe; ſometimes he plaied late in the night before her window, on his Lute, Cytharen, &amp; Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora; ſometimes he turneyed and juſted in her preſence, to move her to love him for his manhood: and ſometimes he ſent her lettters, ſongs, and ſonnets, therein bewraying his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; hoping ſhe would receive him to her ſervant, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with pity. But all ſerved not: for ſhe could no way be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bear him affection; whereat I marvelled greatly, nor could not imagine at the cauſe thereof. For he was a brave va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant young Gent. of great authority and eſtimation, favoured by fortune, as wealthy, rich, and abundant, exorned by nature, being beautifull and fair of complexion, tall and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and of a couragious and reſolute mind, wiſe politick, and witty.

For I being ſent unto her upon a certain morning with a pair of ſilken garters from my maſter, all edged with gold, and invironed with pearls, moſt ſumptuouſly and artificially wrought, ſhe taking the garters out of my hand, gave me a <hi>Portugal Cruſado,</hi> (being worth ſir Engliſh Angels) for my pains.

But as I was departing out of the houſe to let my maſter know of the good news, (hoping thereby to have augmented my <hi>Cruſado</hi> with my maſters li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berallity) ſhe called me again and leading me into her bed-chamber alone, burſt out into theſe words. Ah <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Yea Madam quoth I.) Then (replied ſhe) do you harm your ſelf in indeavouring by your carefull painfull, induſtrious and diligent ſervice, to ſatisfie your maſters deſire, in that he wiſheth her to be his wife, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom thy ſelf mayeſt be a wedded husband.

               <p>When I heard her concluſion, it ſo well liked me, that I conſidered not whether the conſequence followed according to the premiſes or no.

I had never yet followed the Court of <hi>Cupid,</hi> though I had ſerved one of his ſouldiers: and therefore I was to ſéek of mine anſwer, and wiſt not what to ſay. Notwithſtanding that I felt an amourous paſſion creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:165993:27"/> in my heart, contrary to any motion that I had felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For I know not how, my thoughts were ſurprized with love, after <hi>Eleonora</hi> had argued in ſuch order with me, and I feared that ſhe had béen but in ſome merry vein to ieſt, taking her paſtimes in mocking with me. And therefore I made this anſwer, Madam you are very mery this morning, whatſoever the matter is; God grant it be towards your good luck. And you are the bolder with me, becauſe you may. But leaſt my maſter long for my coming I beſéech you to tell me whether it will pleaſe you to command me any ſervice, for I muſt haſt homeward. None other (quoth ſhe) but that thou thank him for his preſent, and give him this from me, which is no leſſe worth then his and ſo I do owe him nothing. Wherewith ſhe reached me a Hat that was ſent her father from a Spaniſh Duke, being a moſt coſtly Iewel. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking my leave, ſhe bid me farewell, adding this clauſe to ſhut up her <hi>Vale,</hi> Moleſt me no more for thy maſter; do for thy ſelf what thou wilt <hi>Maffeo.</hi> To be ſhort. I returned unto my maſter with ſuch anſwer as <hi>Eleonora</hi> commanded me. But I began to be ſo love-ſick, that I knew not how it was poſſible that a man might be ſo greatly altered, and ſo wonderfully changed in ſo ſhort a time. Within a few days after, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had prepared a letter to be ſent to <hi>Elconora,</hi> which I put in my pocket, and walked up and down the ſtreets not far from the place where ſhe dwelled, and when I thought good, I returned home with ſuch anſwer as my brains could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and ſo I ſerved my maſter, obeying the command of <hi>Eleonora.</hi> Who was ſo fixed in my heart, that I could not be ſeparated from the thought of her beauty and excellency one minute of an hour. And though I ſought by all means poſſible to extinguiſh the fire that conſumed me, leaſt at length it might grow to an unquenchable flame; al helped not, I ſtrove againſt the ſtream, and to go about to root out the ſparkles of love, was as hard a matter for me, as it were to any man to pluck the ſtars out of the chriſtaline orb wherein they be ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore at length, not able to endure any longer. I wrote <hi>Eleonora</hi> a Letter to this effect.</p>

               <p>When I had read this letter, I was in worſe caſe then before: it would be too long for me to make rehearſal in what a paſſionate ſtate I was, both while I heard her rail at me like a raging Lyoneſſe and when I ſaw by the reading of the Letter how ſhe ſought to be revenged of me, that I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reſign up my life, and to fall down dead in her preſence for love grief, and fear: and contrarily, gladneſſe and hope made ſuch a combate at one inſtant in the midſt of my heart, that I knew no more of my ſelf, then he that was never born.
<pb facs="tcp:165993:29"/> At length gathering my ſences together, I came to my ſelf; and anſwered her: that whereas ſhe ſometime ſaid, that I was an inſtrument againſt my ſelf, ſhe ſhould now have moſt juſt occaſion to ſay the ſame, and moſt fit matter whereout to gather premiſes producing the concluſion of her ſaying. And though if be my death (quoth I) to do your command, yet I will and muſt obey With that ſhe having ſealed the Letter, I t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ok it and went away; bidding her adieu with all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility that I could for my life. And poſting to my maſter, I delivered him the Letter which was ſo ſpightfully written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poor <hi>Maffeo,</hi> notwithſtanding that I was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the contents thereof, though my maſter knew not ſo much. But aſſoon as he read the letter, ſuppoſing that I had béen the onely cauſe of his bad ſucceſſe in his amours, drew forth his dagger and threw it at me; and ſéeing that though the dagger ſtuck in my leg, yet it had not given me my fatall ſtroke, ran at me with his naked ſword, intending fully to glut himſelf with the bloud of his innocent page, and couſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main (though I as yet then knew not that I was ſo.) But I ſtepped aſide, and got out of the houſe as ſoon as I could, flying unto one of our neighbors who ſeemed to make much of me, and in whom I had moſt confidence. Vnto him I declared how my maſter was fallen out with me, and ſhewed him the wound which he had given me, meaning to ſlay me. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being a poor honeſt man, and a Baker by his occupation, by name <hi>Pharicles,</hi> was likewiſe cunning in chirurgery, and ſo willingly and ſo carefully dreſſed my wound that I thought him worthy of greater reward then I could give him. But the ſmart of the wound, the ſorrow of my grief, and the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of love, caſt me into ſuch a dangerous diſeaſe, that I was in great peril of death, and out of all hope ever to recover my life again. After that I had lain in that caſe ſix or ſeven days, late in the night came <hi>Eleonora</hi> unto me, in the habit of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man page, becauſe ſhe would not be known, and told the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>Pharicles</hi> that ſhe was my couſin, and that ſhe had brought ſomething to make a confection for me. Whereupon the good
<pb facs="tcp:165993:30"/> Baker aroſe, and opening his door let her in, and ſent her up to my chamber. Where ſhe ſéeing that I was alone fell down on her knées before my bed, and wéeping moſt pittifully, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced theſe words. Pardon me ſwéet <hi>Maffeo,</hi> pardon me, and could not for grief ſpeak one word more, but ſhed out whole ſtreams of tears, which running down her chéeks, fell on my bed, and in ſuch ſort wetted it as if it had been caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome river. I amazed at that ſudden chance, could not tell whether I dreamt, or whether I was awake; for me thought by the voice it ſhould be <hi>Eleonora,</hi> but when I looked on her veſture. I ſuſpected it had been my maſter that had repented in ſuch manner, for that he ſo hardly uſed me. But to rid my ſelf from doubt, I reached the candle that ſtood by my beds-head, and looking her in the face, I ſoon knew my <hi>Eleonora,</hi> who was in the like taking that I was when I read that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate letter before her. Incontinently I lifted her from off her knées, embraced her, and kiſſed her on her tender lips, ſaying: What <hi>Eleonora</hi> my Lady and miſtreſſe, do you humble your ſelf after this order unto you ſervant? Pluck up your heart and be of good chear; and ask no pardon at my hands, for you have not committed any fault againſt your ſervant. Ah <hi>Maffeo</hi> (qd. ſhe) my fault is great, and ſo much the greater, becauſe againſt <hi>Maffeo.</hi> After we had paſſed on great part of the night in ſuch talk, ſhe in accuſing her ſelf, and I in reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating my unworthineſs, at laſt we promiſed each other troth; and agreed to leave <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and flie into <hi>Spain.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew that her father would never agrée unto our marriage, ſhe concluded to provide a good ſum of money, and many rich jewels, for the eaſier carriage, and ſo to tranſport her ſelf and me into <hi>Spain,</hi> there to lead a contented life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as we might be reconciled to here father, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune allowed us to return. This deviſe liked me ſo well, that all the medicines in the world, could not have cured my diſeaſe ſo well as the preſence of her, for whom I was ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die. To be ſhort, ſhe appointed me the hour and place where I ſhould méet her, when all things were prepared for
<pb facs="tcp:165993:30"/> our voyage. Where I finding her in the ſame habit that ſhe was when ſhe viſited me, we took ſhip, and ſailed unto Saint <hi>Lucar</hi> in Spain, where we lived contentedly and merrily for the ſpace of five or ſix years. In he mean time you muſt note, how that <hi>Eleonoras</hi> parents marvelling what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her, were excéeding ſorrowful.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y couſin <hi>Sylveſtro,</hi> having heard of her ſecret and ſudden departure and mine alſo, began to ſuſpect that we were together, and that <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> ſent him that letter but to give the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a contrary colour. Wherefore conſidering that the Gods ſo favoured me firſt in that my life was ſaved by means of the pittifull midwife, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that I was loved by ſo noble a gentlewoman where he was rejected, his conſcience began to prick, and urged him ſo far, that on a morning he went to the houſe of <hi>Eleonoras</hi> father, and declared to him the whole matter. Whereat he wondring would have beſought the Magiſtrate to burn <hi>Sylveſtro</hi> at a ſtake; but that <hi>Sylveſtro</hi> promiſed him that he would go to the end of the world but he would find us, and in like manner diſcover the whole caſe unto us, and bring us home to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. In ſo much that ſix years being expired, I eſpied my couſin <hi>Sylveſtro</hi> walking in the Market place, and leaſt he ſhould ſee me, I went homewards to carry the news unto <hi>Eleonora.</hi> But he eſpied me and followed me to the place where I dwelt, and entring into the hall, where I ſate with <hi>Eleonora,</hi> fell down on his knees, and informed us of all the matter: ſhewing us his teſtimoniall letters and paſſeport, from the city of Conſtantinople, wherein was mentioned that he was purpoſely ſent to ſéek us. Beſides he brought letters
<pb facs="tcp:165993:31"/> written with <hi>Eleonoras</hi> father, <hi>Don Franceſco de Guerdonaes</hi> own hand. Whereof we were ſo glad, eſpecially <hi>Eleonora,</hi> that we could not but pardon my maſter, who now became our ſervant. You may well think that we made as ſpeedy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as we could to return to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For within eight days we found a ſhip rigged and throughly furniſhed, with proviſion of victuals, and all things neceſſary, which was bound to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In which ſhip we conveyed our ſelves with all that we had, and hayſing fail, committed the veſſel to <hi>Neptunes</hi> mercy. But variable fortune (that cannot be reduced into any order, ſometimes being lighter then the wind, and flying more ſwiftly then an arrow being ſhot out of the bow, and ſometimes heavy and marching ſlowly, and reſembling the Tortyſe; Variable fortune I ſay) being loth that we ſhould rejoyce of our felicity without any proof of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hap, raiſed ſuch a tempeſt on the ſea, that the ſhip being battered with the ſwelling waves, clove aſunder and burſt into pieces.

                  </gap>t I ſaw my onely <hi>Eleonora</hi> and <hi>Alonſo,</hi> floating on the terrible ſea within the cheſt, and yet I could not come near her, and the traiterous waves would not drive my cork the ſame way that the cheſt was carried. For the winds blew ſo crabbedly that the cheſt floated one way, and I with my curſed cork was driven quite contrary. So that in ſhort ſpace I loſt the ſight
<pb facs="tcp:165993:31"/> of the cheſt, and therewith of all my joy. Imagine gentle ſhepheards in what plight poor <hi>Maffeo</hi> was at that inſtant. For as long as I could ſee my <hi>Eleonora</hi> and her <hi>Alonſo,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the perillous caſe I was in, but after I had loſt that bleſſed ſight, I marked in what danger I was to be ſwallowed up by the greedy waves at every moment. Yet the grief that I ſuffered for that I knew not how <hi>Eleonora</hi> fared, permitted me not to care for my ſelf, who almoſt an hundred times had purpoſed to leave my cork and caſt my ſelf into the depth of the roaring ſea, and very Court where <hi>Neptune</hi> ſate to rail at him for his fierce government. But yet I know not how my dreadfull deſtinies inveigling my heart with vain hope, reſerved me to worſe miſhaps. After that I had rowled up and down the ſeas a whole night, in the morning betimes I eſpied a great ſhip of war on the ſea, ſo that I being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comforted at the ſight thereof, began to call unto them that were aboard of her, as loud as my voice could reach. But the Marriners though they heard not my voice, by reaſon of the noiſe of the waves which did beat againſt the belly of that great ſhip; yet ſeeing me, conſidered in what neceſſity I was, and ſteering the ſhip as near as the ſteer man could, they threw out a cable rope which I catched by the end, and ſo got into the ſhip. Thus God had redreſſed my neceſſity, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it fared with poor <hi>Eleonora</hi> and <hi>Alonſo.</hi> My life was ſaved, but my ſorrow nothing ceaſed, yea increaſed rather. For thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on <hi>Eleonora</hi> and <hi>Alonſo,</hi> I was ſo beſet with grief, that my life was in greater danger, then when I lay rowling up and down the riſing waves on the Cork.

As we had thus rowed one day and a night, we eſpied a cheſt floating on the ſea which by reaſon of the lightneſſe was carried away more ſwifter then our great ſhip. At length it approached ſo near us, that I might well perceive it to be the ſame cheſt wherein my <hi>Eleonora</hi> was. And when I ſaw that no body

Whereupon I fell into ſuch a trance, that having by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Mariners recovered my ſences again, I heard them ſay, that they had never ſeen the like extaſie. O ſpitefull fortune! when ſhe beginneth to frown on men, ſhe never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth untill ſhe maketh them moſt miſerable, and bringeth them into deſpair. And when they are in ſuch diſtreſſe, that they think it impoſſible to be worſe handled, then ſhe to ſhew her power, augmenting their evill, cauſeth them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their hereſie. As I for example, who could be in worſe caſe then I was, when ſprawling on the cork amidſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging waves, I was in danger every moment to be devoured of <hi>Neptune?</hi> Yet I farto worſe when I ioſt the ſight of my deareſt <hi>Eleonora.</hi> And a thouſand times greater was my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, when I ſaw the empty cheſt. At which time, curſing the winds as helping cauſes to my miſhap; the ſea as greedily deſiring the prey, the ſhip as the inſtrument that brought me into that <hi>Charibdis</hi> of calamity, the celeſtial Planets as hard hearted, ſéeing me injured, and not revenging my wrong, the ſtars as witneſſes of my miſery, and fortune as the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, yea <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and onely author of what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſoever had betided me; I would have caſt my ſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board: but my intent being hindered by the Mariners, I was forced to comfort my ſelf as much as the greatneſſe of my hap could permit, and to arm my ſelf with that old poeſie, <hi>Dum Spiro, Spero.</hi> Though my greateſt hope was deſpair, and my life worſe then death.</p>
               <p>Within a few days after, the Mariners taking occaſion by a gale of wind, which blew ſomething ſtrongly, hoyſed up their ſails &amp; arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> within two days after. Where incontinently I went to my father in laws <hi>Don Franceſco de Guerdonas</hi> houſe, and declared the whole hiſtory of our navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto him, how we ſuffered ſhipwrack, how I ſaw <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtro</hi> my couſin fall into the ſea, how I had loſt <hi>Eleonora</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:165993:33"/> my child, &amp; how I was ſaved in the other ſhip. But leaſt I ſhould kill the old Knights heart, I ſuppreſſed the ſight of the empty cheſt. <hi>Don Franceſco</hi> and his Lady, glad to hear their ſon in law ſpeak, but ſorry to underſtand the ſum of his woful relation, fell both into an extaſie. At length the old man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to himſelf ſaid. Ah my dear ſon <hi>Maffeo,</hi> whoſe preſence I have wiſhed for ſo long time. What a diſaſtrous chance is this? what ſpitefull miſhap? what an horrible event? it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that fortune (that monſtrous Goddeſſe) hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to exerciſe what miſchief ſhe can upon thee and thine. Ah <hi>Maffeo,</hi> thou ſéeſt theſe ſilver hairs which cover my face, are tokens how neare I approach to my grave; and yet this heart, which is incloſed in this weak and feeble body, is ſuch, that I might with ſhield and ſpear, encounter with fickle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I doubt not but I ſhould become victorious. But alas, force, manhood, courage, or valour cannot prevail in this caſe; and therefore onely reſteth that we put on the armour of hope. It is not impoſſible, (ſéeing my daughter and her ſon were ſo well placed in a cheſt) that we ſhould hear of her, and perhaps before we are aware, may ſee her. Wherefore ſéeing the Gods have ſaved you, and amidſt ſuch a multitude of miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes brought you home to your Country, I think it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe that you ſhould acquaint your ſelf with the eſtate of your goods, and take poſſeſſion of ſuch lands and houſes which, your honourable father dying, your traiterous couſin <hi>Sylveſtro</hi> inherited. Whereunto I anſwered, that well I might do it, but never ſhould enjoy any pleaſure though all the goods, riches, and kingdomes of the world were mine, unleſſe I had my <hi>Eleonora</hi> and her child preſent with me: and therefore I meant not to ſtay at Conſtantinople. Which done, I took my leave of my kind father, and mother in law (who ſo wept at my departure, that it might have moved any man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration) and ſo leaving them, I betook me to my fortune, meaning to try whether ſhe would ſome time turn her whéel, and become more favourable then ſhe was accuſtomed to be. After I had travelled by ſea and land, ſo far that I marched
<pb facs="tcp:165993:34"/> through moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> through a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> at laſt I ſhipped from the Weſt-Indies, towards <hi>Spain,</hi> where I had béen thrée times before. For I know not how, my mind gave me that if ſhe lived, I ſhould hear of her there, thinking that ſhe could land no where but in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our ſhip was drowned near the coaſt thereof. But all helped not in all thoſe thrée years (for ſo long I had travelled ſithens my laſt departure from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) no living creature could tell me any news of <hi>Eleonora</hi> or the child And therefore I would not return to my country, but thought to run over all <hi>Spain,</hi> and throughly ſearch the whole Country, for I hoped not to find her in any place, if I found her not in <hi>Spain;</hi> though my hope was little or none to find her at all, conſidering that I had ſéen, the unhappy cheſt ſpoiled of her carriage. When I had ranged up and down the dry fields and ſandy meadows of the country nine days, at length I came into a moſt pleaſant green, through which there can as delectable a river as mans eye might behold, the banks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were beſet with Orange and Lemon trees; which by reaſon of their fruit caſt forth ſuch a fragrant and odoriferous ſmell, that the very odour thereof did perfume the air in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it did ſpread the ſame ſmell over all the neighbour greens and meadows of that quarter. So that the coldneſſe of the river, the ſhadow of the trees, and the odoriferous ſcent of the fruit, enticed me to reſt my weary limbs on the river ſide; where the pleaſing noiſe of the murmuring ſtream did bring me into the ſweeteſt ſleep I could have wiſhed. You muſt note, that the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nk on the other ſide of the river was ſomething high by reaſon whereof, my dear <hi>Eleonora</hi> (whom I ſo painfully ſought) lay in the graſſe againſt the bank on the other ſide the river, not being ſeen. Who whileſt I was a ſleep, chanced to riſe up, and ſéeing me lie with my face upward knew me. How glad ſhe was (gentle ſhepheards) I leave unto your diſcretion to judge of. But ſhe willing to try what remembrance I had of her plucked off a lemon in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor like to the Indian gold, and in it ingraved this diſtichon.</p>

               </q>
               <p>And caſting the carved lemon on my breaſt, ſhe lurked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the bank leſt I ſhould ſée her. But I ſlept ſo ſoundly, that although I felt the lemon fall juſt upon my breaſt, yet I ſtarted not; for in that paradice I feared nothing: but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that the lemon was ſhaken off by the wind, I was loth to give over my ſléep ſo ſoon, and therefore I turned my ſelf to fall into ſléep again. But as I held the lemon that was caſt at me in my hand, I felt that it was ſomething rough: willing therefore to ſee what kind of lemon it was, I read the poeſſe, and no ſooner eſpied the name of <hi>Eleonora,</hi> but my heart ſeemed to leap out of my body for joy. Yet becauſe I ſaw not her, nor any man in the world near me, I could not tell what to imagine of that lemon; but concluded at laſt, that the Gods had ſent me that eminent token in ſign that I ſhould hear of <hi>Eleonora</hi> and the child. At length ſhe called on the other ſide of the bank, <hi>Maffeo, Maffeo,</hi> why doeſt thou not ſpeak to thy <hi>Eleonora?</hi> Wherewith I as a man raging mad, looked up to the skies, ſometimes down into the river, and ſometimes over the meadow, and ſéeing no mortall wight, I brake out into this open exclamation.</p>
               <p>O miſerable wretch that I am! I ran over the world to ſéek my beloved <hi>Eleonora,</hi> and now I have found her, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee her. Where art thou <hi>Eleonora,</hi> where art thou? Or doth an eccho rebound the ſound of thy voice from the other part of the world unto mine ears? Or do I dream? Or do I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to hear that which I do not? Or is it the ghoſt of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> that calleth unto her <hi>Maffeo?</hi> And if that be, why am not I a ghoſt alſo? Or have the Gods hearing her bewail her miſeries pittied her complaints, and changed her into one of theſe delectable lemon trees? Or have the ſacred nimphs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raviſhed with the love of <hi>Eleonoraes</hi> beauty, led her with them into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecret bowels of this pleaſant river? ſurely I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb facs="tcp:165993:35"/> it is ſo. And therefore <hi>Maffeo</hi> make haſt to follow her. Caſt thy ſelf into the ſilver ſtreams <hi>Maffeo,</hi> and they will bring thee to thy wiſhed and long ſought for <hi>Eleonora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I being ready to leap into the water, <hi>Eleonora</hi> roſe up, and came on the top of the bank, right over againſt me, ſaying. Stay <hi>Maffeo,</hi> ſtay, <hi>Eleonora</hi> is here; and here mayeſt thou behold thy ſon <hi>Alonſo.</hi> At the fight whereof I was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that I knew not whether I did but dream, or whether it was ſo indeed. At laſt knitting my wits together, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I was not deceived or inchanted, but that with my naturall eys I beheld my wife and my ſon, being a pretty tall wag about four years old. But to ſee the churliſh nature of fortune who though ſhe ſeem to favour men, yet ſhe doth in ſuch manner with wrinkled frowns intermingle her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that they have no cauſe fully to rejoice of her benefits. And ſo it fared with us, for what greater chance in the world might have glutted our hearts more with joy then this that I ſeeking <hi>Eleonora</hi> found her, and <hi>Eleonora</hi> ſeeking <hi>Maffeo</hi> found him likewiſe, each of them ſaluting the other, and ſpeaking the one to the other? And yet contrarily, what greater grief then this that we had found each other, ſaw each other, and ſpake one to another, and yet could not come one to the other; being ſeparated by that, being ſomthing large and very deep. I could not ſwim, <hi>Eleonora</hi> leſſe: and ſo we were in the pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt taking that might be in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleonora</hi> told me that ſhe had travelled one day and a half along the bank-ſide of the river, and had ſeen no bridge from the place where ſhe was, unto the ſide where I was, Inſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much that we could not imagine how we might do to travell both together; for we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What remedy I wanted my ſword to cut down trees to ſerve me for a bridge, and looſe wood there was none. Nothing reſted but this, that we ſhould travell along the river by the banks ſide, ſhe of the one ſide of it, and I on the other
<pb facs="tcp:165993:35"/> ſide of it, untill ſuch time as we had found means to get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>After we had marched in that ſort four or five hours, (in which ſpace ſhe had declared me how ſhe was ſaved from the preſent danger of drowning, by the means of a Spaniſh gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; how that the chief ruler of the ſtaves that rowed in the galley kept her in a cloſe priſon, becauſe ſhe would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his wicked and filthy deſires; and how that by means of one of the galley ſlaves after ſhe had been in that miſerable and loathſome captivity two years and a half, ſet on ſhore, and brought to a country village not paſſing forty miles from the place where I found her) we met with a ſhepheard &amp; his wife, who told us that we ſhould within a ſmall mile find a bridge to paſſe over the river, whereof we were paſſing glad. And in ſhort ſpace reaching to the bridge, I paſſed over to the other ſide, and embraced my beloved <hi>Eleonora,</hi> &amp; my young <hi>Olphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who began prettily well to prattle in the Spaniſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for his mother uſed continually to ſpeak Spaniſh unto him. But mark (gentle ſhepheards) how fortune ſtill ſought to bar us from perfect felicity. For as we were thus imbracing one the other, and rejoycing of our good ſucceſſe after ſo much ill ſuck and ſo many dangerous chances; came thrée tall lubberly Moors, each having a good cudgell in his fiſt who approaching near us, and being enamoured with the beauty of <hi>Eleonora,</hi> preſently fell upon me, and hinding me hand and foot, rowled me to the bank-ſide where they left me; But <hi>Eleonora</hi> and the boy they carried with them, whither I knew not, untill the next morning, that ſhe having eſcaped from the Villains (who were ſo buſie in robbing a Farmers houſe, that they took but little regard of her) told me her ſelf, being returned to the ſame place where they left me b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>und. You muſt note, that the thée vs had ſet <hi>Eleonora</hi> with her child upon this horſe which they had ſtolen, with all the furniture belonging unto it, from ſome Farmer by the way, and had loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it with ſwords and other weapons, with all which, ſhe ran away, and reſted not till ſhe approached the bridge, néer
<pb facs="tcp:165993:36"/> which I lay bound. I very glad to ſée her and my ſon incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently caſt of all the weapons and other traſh, ſaving this ſword which I kept for my defence. And thinking it ſcarce ſafe to ſtay long in that place we rode on a good pace, till we reached to a ſmall village, where we lighted.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as we perceived the darkneſſe of the night to fly from the beautifull glimps of Lady <hi>Aurora,</hi> to horſe we hied, and rode on ſtill towards the next haven. But <hi>Phoebus</hi> dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his beams on the plains, ſo enflamed the air with the heat thereof, that we were compelled about mid-day to alight, and to ſhroud our ſelves from the Sun, under a Trée that ſtood in the middeſt of the high-way. The paſſing heat made me ſlumber, and from that ſlumbring I fel ſo faſt aſleep, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking, I miſſed <hi>Eleonora,</hi> and what was become of her, I knew not, but that the child which was by me cried and told me as well as it could, that the naughty man had run away with his mother. Whereby I ſuſpected that ſome villain or other was by Fortune ſuborned again to croſſe me with her curriſh envy. In what grief and perplexity I was at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, you may think (gentle ſhepheards) by your ſelves how perplexed you would be if you were in the like caſe: yet ſéeing it was not the firſt time I had been in like taking, I ſtuck to patience, and cleaved to hope. For my heart was ſo hardened in unfortunate events, &amp; unhappy chances, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Fortune and all her power, I could better behave my ſelf in adverſity then I was accuſtomed. And therefore ſpéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaping on horſeback, I took up my <hi>Alonſo</hi> with me, &amp; rode till I came to the next village, where leaving the child with an honeſt ſhepheard (unto whom I declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe wherein I was, promiſing to reward him throughly for the boys mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance til I fetched him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which I hoped would not have been long) &amp; deſiring him to uſe it well, I poſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſéek ſwéet <hi>Eleonora,</hi> that poor <hi>Eleonora</hi> whoſe life was ſo miſerable, becauſe ſo dear to me. As I courſed with my ſteed up &amp; down the wildeſt and ſolitarieſt places of the country at length this morning (being the ſixt day after I loſt <hi>Eleonora</hi>) I fel into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:165993:36"/> hands of the ſame villains that took away <hi>Eleonora</hi> the firſt time, when they tyed me by the unfortunate Bridge. Theſe on every ſide aſſailed me, ſome behind, ſome before, and ſome of them on each ſide of me: for they had increaſed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by four men, ſo that there were ſeven of them. Yet by the help of the Gods and my ſword, I ſo acquitted my ſelf, that with no worſe wounds then theſe, I got from them, and recovered this Scarff, which <hi>Eleonora</hi> for haſt had forgotten and left behind her, when ſhe ran away with this horſe.</p>
               <p>Thus (gentle ſhepheards) have you heard the whole hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my life, and I hope you are ſatisfied as concerning your queſtion. Now I am to requeſt you, to give me leave to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on my journey; for until I find <hi>Eleonora,</hi> I cannot reſt. And ſo <hi>Maffeo,</hi> thanking them for their courteous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, took his leave and departed. Now therefore leaving him to ſéek <hi>Eleonora,</hi> we will proceed in rehearſing the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Perierio</hi> his ſtrange love.</p>

For it was altogether caſual and accidentary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:165993:37"/> might they hope that ever he might enjoy his love, for that there was nothing leſſe like, yea it ſéemed rather impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>For they conſidered, firſt, that he had never ſéen the Lady before that time nor after; by reaſon whereof, though he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſée her, perchance ſhould not know her. Secondly, they marked that he knew not her name, her parents, or Country, to enquire after her: ſo that the neareſt place he knew where he might find her, was the world, and the propereſt <hi>individi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to denominate her, was a certain woman.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, they perpended that ſhe ſought for ſome other Knight, who had her heart in hold; and therefore a very hard matter, though <hi>Perierio</hi> ſhould find her, to obtain her love. All this conſidered and weighed, they ſought to root love out of <hi>Perierio</hi> his breſt, which <hi>Cupid</hi> had ſo pierced with his dart, that all the perſwaſions of the world could not ſerve to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the fire which was kindled in his heart, and increaſed more and more dayly. In ſo much that the fire being enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and beginning to torment him with inſupportable pain, he determined to commit himſelf and his caſe to Fortune, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that as the cauſe of his grief was accidentary, ſo the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect might by chance be redreſſed and remedied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> thus reſolved, asked, and obtained leave (though with much adde) of his aged father, to travel into far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to ſée and learn ſuch things as a young Gentleman ought to know, alledging that there was nothing more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory to youth, then to paſſe over thoſe years which are apt to comprehend and learn, in foul obſcurity of ignorance. In ſo much that a young man that will live in credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ought to travel into ſtrange countries, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with forreign manners and governments, to learn tongues, to haunt Vniverſities, and inſinuate himſelf into the company of learned men. All this Father (quoth <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erio</hi>) is neceſſary for them that will have their lives famous, and death honourable.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:37"/>
               <p>Old <hi>Camillo</hi> replied with <hi>Horace:</hi>
                  <q>Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mane currunt.</q> Men change not their manners, but the aire, that run from country to country, <hi>Perierio.</hi> And therefore I am not of their opinion that believe that men by far travelling from home, can attain to wiſdome and humane prudence. For I think, that that is not gotten by running into far Countries, or by living in exile farre from home, but rather by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and converſation of wiſe men. Yet <hi>Perierio</hi> ſéeing that here in this multitude of ſhepheards, little wiſdome is to be learned, or little profit to experience and prudence to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. I and content that thou go to the Vniverſity of <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which is within this kingdom, and there to repeat ſuch ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments as thou haſt begun at <hi>Rome,</hi> that thou mayſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be apt to greater ſtudies, and to exorn and beautifie thy mind with the brightneſs of the liberal Sciences which are the lights of humane underſtanding: Laſtly, alſo to fenſe thy mind with wiſe and ſage precepts of Phyloſophy, that after thou haſt attained to the knowledge of natural things, thou maiſt uſe moral Philoſophy to moderate thy affections, and to follow that which thou knoweſt to be honourable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, ſhunning the contrary. Then art thou fully armed to paſſe forward, &amp; to travel into other countries to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſtrange cuſtomes, or to learn diverſe tongues; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe what profiteth it to have courſed through ſundry and ſtrange regions, and to have ſéen many kingdomes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of divers Nations, if he that travelleth wanteth the ripeneſs of wit and judgement to reap profit by his being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: Therefore <hi>Perierio,</hi> think not that I diſallow of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, but would have them that take that courſe, not to have their ſtomacks empty, but firſt guard themſelves with the knowledge of Philoſophy and humanity, and furniſh themſelves with proviſion neceſſary to ſuch journeying. For I remember that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> to deſcribe and form an
<pb facs="tcp:165993:38"/> heroical man adorned with all vertues, fained that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> had travelled through all the world; and not thinking this ſufficient, they fained that they deſcended into hell, and went into the Elizian Fields, and knew thoſe that were in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> hearing his father alledge ſuch points as made for his purpoſe, was excéeding glad, at length obtained his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good will to leave the countrey and ruſtick company of Shepheards, to haunt the comely and ſeemly converſation of Schollers though his mind was more moved to his Lady then to the Vniverſity, whither old <hi>Camilla</hi> determined to ſend him. And although <hi>Euphilia</hi> and <hi>Perina</hi> knew the colour wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he painted the occaſion of his travelling, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the whole ſorrow to themſelves, without declaring it to their father, fearing leſt he ſhould be diſcouraged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted thereby, that he might hinder his health, and for grief fall into ſickneſs, conſidering that old age is ſo ſubject to diſeaſes, that the leaſt cauſe in the world of diſcontent is ſufficient to ſubvert the eſtate of health in an aged perſon.</p>

               <p>Thus <hi>Perierio</hi> having travelled ſix dayes through Woods,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:38"/> dales, buſhes, gréens, medows, hills, valies, and other ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary place, and yet had not met with that which he ſought, nor ſéen any likelihood thereof, began to be wonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, and thought his pain vainly beſtowed, ſéeing that Fortune was blinde and made no diſcretion of perſons, but ever wrought by chance, beſtowing her favours not where ſhe would, but where they fell. <hi>Perierio</hi> thus diſcomforted, climing on the top of a hil, heard a moſt ſwéet and melodious voyce ſounding to a harp within a little wood where the high O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kes made a pleaſant ſhadow. And drawing néer to the wood, he marked that it was the voice of a ſhepheard, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ended her ſong, began thus to complaine of her misfortune. No doubt but all the ſtarrs that from the skies ſend light on the earth, have agréed and conſented to my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap and ill fortune; neither is there any thing on earth, that may yield me any comfort or conſolation; but love which is ſubject to fear, turneth and converteth my ſorrowfull ſoule into pure ice. Ah Fortune, how canſt thou be ſo cruel? How canſt thou forbear to ſuccour a heart ſo diſtreſſed as mine, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am falſly ſuſpected of diſloyalty? And therefore I muſt accuſe thée <hi>Lexander,</hi> thou art the man whom I muſt burthen with the cauſe of all my grief; unto thée do I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and unfold my plaints, hard-hearted and cruell <hi>Lexander,</hi> in whom no pitty taketh place: For if thou wer'ſt of my ſide, I would not care though Heaven Earth Love and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were againſt me, and enemies unto me. After that ſhe had ended her complaint, ſhe fetched a heavy ſigh from her heart, and therewith wept ſo bitterly, that <hi>Perierio</hi> might eaſily perceive that ſhe was in that pittiful and lamentable taking, by reaſon that her husband falſly ſuſpected her to be diſloyal and unfaithful; ſo that he entred into the wood and found her ſitting upon the graſſe in the ſhade, néere to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Fountain, which iſſuing from the top of the hill, ran along a great part of the wood in divers places. But when ſhe ſaw <hi>Perierio</hi> comming neer her, though ſhe was ſomething diſcontented that ſhe was interpelled amidſt her
<pb facs="tcp:165993:39"/> paſſions; yet beholding that he ſeemed by his behaviour to be ſome Shepheard of great account, being moſt courteouſly by him greeted, ſaluted him likewiſe with ſuch modeſty, that he began to miſdoubt whether ſhe were <hi>Alcida</hi> the promiſed ſpouſe of <hi>Marcelio.</hi> (For he called to mind how that <hi>Marcelio</hi> had told him and his ſiſters, that <hi>Alcida</hi> had cloathed her ſelf in the habit of a Shepheard, becauſe ſhe might be the harder to be found by him) and therefore ſpake thus unto her, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Shepheard (for ſo your coat bewrayeth, though your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular grace make me ſuſpect that your calling is contrary to your colours,) I ſhall deſire you not to be diſcomforted, though I have troubled you at this time, intruding my ſelf into your company, for as I have diſcourteouſly offended, ſo ſhall you find me moſt ready to make amends for my boldnes.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our Village dwelled a certain Farmer that had a comely youth to his ſon, in beauty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the Shepheards thereabout, being called <hi>Alanio,</hi> who féeding his ſhéep in a paſture ground, not far from ours uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to come to me and keep me company ſitting in the ſhadow by me, and telling of tales, or paſſing over the time with ſome other kind of honeſt recreation; whereby at laſt grew ſuch a familiar acquaintance betwixt us, that love joyning our hearts together, we were not well while we were ſeparated the one from the others company. To be ſhort, he loved me, and was loved of me. There was in the ſame Village a fair beautiful Shepheardeſſe called <hi>Selvagia,</hi> who for her beauty might be compared with <hi>Venus</hi> in the valley before <hi>Parys,</hi> when ſhe won the golden Apple. Of which Shepheard my <hi>Alanio</hi> became enamoured; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I to be revenged on him fained to favour <hi>Lexander</hi> his deadly enemy. Which fained love of mine, at length by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the acquaintance that grew between us, changed into ſuch pure and true love, that by reaſon thereof I am fallen into the miſery, in which I now finde my ſelfe at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Now, continuing the hiſtory of my life, you ſhall know that <hi>Lexanders</hi> father called <hi>Filene,</hi> ſometimes frequented my fathers houſe, by reaſon of certain buſineſſe that my father and he had betwéen them concerning Oxen and Kyne, and ſéeing me although he was ſomething old, yet he fell in love with me and that ſo greatly, that he became fooliſh, mad, and frantick: He became ſo importunate unto me, and troubling me above a thouſand times, daily declared me his paſſions &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:165993:40"/> grief, but all could not help: For I would never give eare to his prattle, nor mark what he ſaid, and though he had been much younger or leſſe aged, and by many parts more perfect then he was, yet for him could I not have forgotten his ſon <hi>Lexander,</hi> who had ſo won my heart, that I had wholly given him the poſſeſſion thereof. The old man knew not what friendſhip was between his ſon and me, for <hi>Lexander</hi> was ſo obeyſant and dutifull, that he behaved himſelf ſecretly in wooing me, leaſt his father knowing thereof ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him, and have occaſion to be angry with him. And in like manner, was <hi>Lexander</hi> altogether ignorant of his fathers folly, who becauſe he ſhould not give his ſon example of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, took all the regard he might to his love from him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the fooliſh cocks-comb, ceaſed not to moleſt me with importunate requeſts to take him to my husband. He made me wonderful large proffers, he promiſed to give me many cloathes and jewels, and he ſent me many Letters, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby to change my mind. In his time he had been a Shepheard moſt excellently qualified, eloquent in ſpéech, and witty, which you may eaſily gather by a Letter which he wrote me, as I yet remember.</p>

                     <p>FAir Shepheard, love is cauſe of all ſuch fault as I can commit in writing unto, hoping that I have not commited any in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you. And if perhaps my Letter be troubleſome unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve certainly, that I already fear the anſwer you will make. I have a thouſand times ſignified and declared unto you, what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I bear you, and in recompence thereof, you take pleaſure in mocking me. You openly laugh at me to ſee me like to dye for love of you; but as for me I am glad to ſee you laugh, though it be to my ruine and deſtruction; For when I remember and think of my evil, and ſee that you take pleaſure therein, rejoycing at my miſery, I perceive that you will not remedy my grief, inſomuch that it were an exceeding folly for me to regard your mocking, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:165993:41"/> that my life and death conſiſteth in you, to diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe. If you ask why I ſhould love you? I anſwer, becauſe I am forced, and cannot but love you, inſomuch that though I might live and not love you, yet I had rather to dye, then ſo to live; for when I remember your graces and perfections, I cannot but judge them happier that die for love of you, then thoſe that can behold you without admiring your exceeding vertues; for I cannot be perſwaded that a man may die more happily, then he who loſeth his life by reaſon of ſuch heavenly beauty as yours, which hath ſo pierced my breaſt, that I am not mine own, but yours: for as ſoon as I ſaw you, I began to love, and to pine for grief. And if you ſay that I am to be blamed becauſe I am amourous and yet old; in that reſpect I ſue for remedy unto you, ſeeing that I have not ſo greatly offended in loving you, as in knowing you ſo late; For I acknowledge that I am old, and I am not a little grieved that this my pain is not as ancient as the courſe of my age; and I am ſorry that I might not have loved you from the firſt day that I was born as well as ſince the firſt hour that I ſaw you, certifying you that this love ſhall dure and continue till death. Marvel not ſweet, to ſee me grey and wrinkled; and though you ſurpaſs me in valour, yet I think it but ſmall reaſon that a man ſhould loſe his pay and ſalary under this colour, that he is an old Souldier. The new built houſes are not comparable to the ancient buildings of <hi>Rome;</hi> and commonly all men alwayes ſay, that among all things, the old is the beſt. Love would not untill this preſent time make me feel the pinching pain of amorous paſſions, becauſe he well knew that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was more firm, and fancy leſs fickle in an old man as I am, then in tender age, where every look is love, and every face a new fancy. I am firm and conſtant to love you for ever; and old, never to be loved as long as I live. Young men that ſay they love, are double and ſubtle; they fain, but not fancy; their forehead is marked with <hi>Venus</hi> badge, but their heart never felt <hi>Cupids</hi> ſhaft. And when they plead for mercy, alledging that they dye for love, then are they leſs ſubject to paſſion &amp; moſt free from fancy. Their changeable affection, is aſſured liberty; their paſſion, paſtime; their love, a cuſtome and not a pain. Think not ſweet, that I am
<pb facs="tcp:165993:41"/> like the amourous youth, who having received a favour of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, vaunteth and boaſteth thereof to all the world; for though I had received ten thouſand, I ſhould be as conſtant and firme in keeping them ſecret: But as I ſee you diſpoſed and bent to work my death, I fear that I ſhall endure much torment, and have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay little, and brag leſs; yet the chiefeſt favour whereof I may boaſt, is to die for the love of <hi>Iſmenia.</hi> With what great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may I find fault with the time, conſidering that I who love you moſt, am leaſt eſteemed. But alas, I loved you too late, and ſeeing I was not born at the ſame time that you were, it is reaſon that I ſhould dye for love of you. Ah fair Shepheardeſs, had my Fortune been ſuch, that I might have been of your time, I had had that which had been ſufficient to win your love, and to deſerve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of you; for though it becommeth no man to blaze his owne praiſes, yet affection forceth me to ſay, that among all the young men of our time, none might compare with me, at dancing, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, foot-ball, hand-ball, bowle, bow, cithren, pipe, flute, and all ſuch kinds of exerciſe, wherewith our Countrey youths recreate themſelves and win the hearts of their miſtreſſes. But (ah cruell chance!) what ſerveth either that which is, or that which hath been, unto him poor wretch, that is buried in the bowels of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, becauſe he is neer unto his death? In the mean time, may it pleaſe you to conſider by that which I have ſaid, that the glory of your perfection which at this preſent maketh you famous to all the countrey, ſhall finally fade, as the pride of the ſweet violet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caieth with the fall of the Sommer. Now you are hard as a rock, and cruel, but when you ſhall be overtaken with age, then ſhall you want the liberty and force wherewith now you diſdain me. For this is the revenge which love taketh of you, that he then brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth you into deadly pain and torments, when hope beginneth to fail you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Filene</hi> ſent me this Letter and many more, with other Songs and Sonnets, wherewith if I had bin as greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as contented and delighted, he had Iudged himſelf happy, and had been ill wedded; but it was impoſſible to finde any where
<pb facs="tcp:165993:42"/> means whereby the picture and image of my beloved <hi>Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> might be raſed out of my heart; For he ſo pleaſed me, and was ſo conſtant and perfect in love, that his wil and mine was but one will, his word and mine one word, and his heart and mine one heart. Never did he perform leſs in deed, then in word he promiſed. His doings were alwaies correſpondent to his ſayings. And as for me, what <hi>Lexander</hi> liked, I could not miſlike; and whatſoever diſpleaſed him, was horrible to <hi>Iſmenia.</hi> In this pleaſant life and ſweet concord having paſſed certain years, we purpoſed to confirm and eſtabliſh our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and to ſigne our wiſhed deſire with the ſeale of honeſt and chaſte marriage. And although <hi>Lexander</hi> before he would take me to his wife, intended to ſpeak unto his father firſt, and to ask his conſent as it beſéemed an obedient ſon to do, yet when I had advertiſed him how that his father would not be willing to agrée unto that match, by reaſon of the fooliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had himſelf to take me in marriage he eſtéeming more of his own content and the eſtate of his own life, then of his due obeyſance towards his father, concealed the matter. So that this unfortunate marriage, was made with the conſent and good will of my father, at whoſe houſe the wedding was kept, where there was ſuch feaſts, games, ſports and paſtimes held, in reſpect of our marriage that it was ſpoken of in all the Boroughs and Villages thereabout. When the amorous old man knew that his own ſon had deprived him of his love, he became ſo furious againſt <hi>Lexander</hi> and me, that he hated us both, and abhorred us worſe then death it ſelf, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he would never after ſée us, or come néer us.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, a certain ſhepheardeſs of the ſame vilage, called <hi>Feliſarde,</hi> who ſo fancied <hi>Lexander,</hi> that ſhe almoſt fell mad for love of him (who made no account of her by reaſon that he loved me ſo well, and becauſe ſhe was an elderly Maid and nothing well complexioned,) ſéeing that he whom ſhe ſo dearly loved had wedded me, almoſt fell into diſpair. In ſo much that our marriage bred us two deadly enemies. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry old man to have occaſion to disinherit his ſon, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:165993:42"/> to marry ſome fair young woman, by whom he might have children; but though he was excéeding rich, yet all the ſhepheards of our country diſdained to be married unto him. except <hi>Feliſarde</hi> onely, who to have opportunity to allure my husband to her unlawfull and diſhoneſt luſt, (for ſhe had not as yet forgotten the love of <hi>Lexander</hi>) willingly took old <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> to her husband. She had not long time béen married, but ſhe began to practiſe meanes to gain the love of my husband, and for that intent ſhe ſent a Maid that ſerved her, called <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veria,</hi> unto <hi>Lexander,</hi> to tell him that if he would grant her her will, ſhe would obtain pardon for him from his father; and beſides, ſhe would do him much pleaſure, and ſhew him great favour; but ſhe could never corrupt him with all her large proffers and fair promiſes to conſent to her wicked wil; wherefore ſhe conſidering that ſhe was ſo deſpiſed and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded of <hi>Lexander,</hi> began mortally to hate him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured continually to move her husband more and more to indignation againſt his ſon. Neither was ſhe content with that but determined alſo to practiſe a ſtrange and villanous treaſon againſt us both; for ſhe had in ſuch a maner won the heart of <hi>Sylveria</hi> her maid, by reaſon of her flattering promiſes and other favours which ſhe had done her, that ſhe was ready to do whatſoever ſhe would have her, although it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lexander,</hi> whom ſhe reſpected for the time that ſhe had ſerved in his fathers houſe. So that they ſecretly conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, how they might be revenged of me, and at the hour appointed for the execution thereof, <hi>Sylveria</hi> went forth of the Village, and comming to a certain Gréen néere the River, where <hi>Lexander</hi> uſed to féed his ſhéep, ſhe ſtepped unto him, and with a troubled countenance as if ſhe had ſome matter of great importance to tell him, ſpake unto him in this maner. Ah <hi>Lexander,</hi> how well and prudently have you done in eſchuing the love of your wicked mother in law, unto which although I ſometimes encited you, yet know that I did ſo by reaſon of her importunate requeſts; but now I know how the matter ſtandeth, ſhe ſhall not be able any more to
<pb facs="tcp:165993:43"/> make me the meſſenger of her diſhoneſties, I am acquainted with ſome of her ſecrets that concern her nearly, and are ſuch, that if you knew them, although your father be ſo cruell unto you, yet would you not leave to hazard your life for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I will not ſay any more, becauſe I know you to be ſo wiſe, and indued with ſuch diſcretion, that it ſhall not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to uſe many words and reaſons in your behalf. <hi>Lexander</hi> being aſtoniſhed to hear her talk in this order, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſome diſhoneſty of his ſtep-mother. But to know the truth, and to be throughly informed, he deſired <hi>Sylveria</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to ſhew him all the matter, and to let him hear what it was that ſhe knew of <hi>Fehſarde</hi> her miſtreſſe. At firſt ſhe would be prayed, ſéeming to be unwilling to diſcloſe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo ſecret; but at length ſhe declaring that unto <hi>Lexander,</hi> which he demanded of her, and which ſhe ſo greatly deſired to tell him, ſtuffed him with a lie moſt notably well forged and contrived. Saying, and conſidering that it is a matter of great weight both unto your ſelf and your father <hi>Filene</hi> in like manner, to know that which I know: I will moſt plainly declare it unto you, aſſuring my ſelf that you will not let any man know how that I have diſcovered this ſecret unto you. You ſhall underſtand, that your mother in law <hi>Feliſarde</hi> hath purpoſed to defile your fathers bed with a certain ſhepheard, whoſe name I will not tell you, ſéeing it lyeth in you to know him if you pleaſe; for if you will come this evening and enter into that place where I will lead you, you ſhall finde the Traitreſs with the Adulterer in your fathers houſe, for they have ſo appointed it, becauſe that <hi>Filene</hi> your father doth this night lye abroad, and doth not returne till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about midday, by reaſon of certain affaires moving him thereto. Therefore prepare your ſelf (if you will follow my counſaile) and about eleven of the clock at night come unto me to our houſe, where I will bring you to the place, where you may eaſily do that which you ſhall think convenient for the honor and credit of your father; and by meanes whereof, you may alſo be reconciled unto him. <hi>Sylveria</hi> ſaid all this, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb facs="tcp:165993:43"/> ſo cunningly, that <hi>Lexander</hi> reſolved to put himſelf in danger to be revenged of him that thought ſo fouly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour his father: And thus the traitreſs <hi>Sylveria,</hi> glad that ſhe had deceived my husband by the counſel of <hi>Feliſarde,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home, to let <hi>Feliſarde</hi> know the effect of her talk with <hi>Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and what he appointed to do.</p>

Where was ever ſuch treaſon ſeen? Or where ſuch malice thought? She took him by the innocent hand, and aſcending the ſtaires as ſoftly as they might, ſhe led him to the chamber doore where <hi>Filene</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay with <hi>Feliſarde</hi> aſleep; when ſhe had brought him there, ſhe ſaid, Lo <hi>Lexander</hi> now are you in place where you ought to have your heart and hand required in ſuch a caſe.

                  </gap> you ſhal finde your ſtep-mother in bed with the adulterer. With that ſhe got away, and retired as ſwift as ſhe could. <hi>Lexander</hi> being deceived by that diſſembling traitreſs gave faith to her words, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging himſelf, drew his Punyard, and having thruſt open the doore with his foot, entered into the Chamber like a furious man, and being inraged, with a loud voyce uttered theſe words: Traytor, I will preſently make thée dye, the loves of <hi>Feliſarde</hi> ſhall but little availe thée; nay they ſhall be the cauſe of thy death and ruine. And ſo ſaying, altogether enraged, and not knowing who was in bed with <hi>Feliſarde</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:165993:44"/> ſtepmother, lifted up his hand to clap his weapon into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breſt; but as Fortune would have it, old <hi>Filene</hi> knew his ſon by reaſon of the light which was in the chamber, and thinking that <hi>Lexander</hi> purpoſely came to kill him, becauſe he had ſo ill uſed him both in word and déed, ſate upright in his bed, and croſſing his arms ſpake thus unto <hi>Lexander.</hi> Ah my ſon, what cruelty moveth thee to become the butcher of thy natural father? Call your judgement, and enter into your wits again, and ſeek not to ſhed my blood, or tearm my life with ſo tragical an end. For if I have been ſomething rigorous unto you, and unnaturally dealt with you being my ſon, I crave pardon, intending to become moſt favourable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you ever hereafter. When <hi>Lexander</hi> perceived the treaſon of <hi>Sylveria,</hi> which had almoſt been cauſe that he had ſlain his own father, he fell into ſuch an extaſie, that his force failed him, and his dagger fell out of his hand without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for he was ſo amazed of the treaſon which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt his father (had not God provided the contrary) that he could not feel his weapon drop out of his hand, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together troubled and confounded like a man that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of all his ſences, went preſently out of the chamber, and out of his houſe. <hi>Feliſarde</hi> knowing what ſhould chance that night, watched for the comming of <hi>Lexander,</hi> who was no ſooner entred in the chamber, but ſhe leaping out of her bed fled into a more inward and back room, where bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the door, ſhe fréed and exempted her ſelf from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and anger of <hi>Lexander.</hi> But when ſhe ſaw that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and by reaſon thereof ſhe out of danger, returning to her bed where <hi>Filene</hi> lay, trembling at the peril which he had ſo wonderfully eſcaped, ſhe began to ſtir up her husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lexander</hi> his ſon, exclaiming in this manner.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Filene,</hi> now may you ſée what a ſon you have, and know that to be moſt true which I ſo often have admoniſhed you, concerning his evil nature and inclination.</p>
               <p>O cruel <hi>Lexander!</hi> O traytor <hi>Lexander!</hi> how commeth it to paſſe that Heaven doth not confound thée? why doth not
<pb facs="tcp:165993:44"/> the earth open and ſwallow thée up into her bowels? why do not the brute beaſts tear thée to pieces? and why do not all men perſecute thee, and puniſh thee according to thy heinous actions. Accurſed be thy mariage, accurſed be thy diſobeiſance, accurſed be thy loves, and accurſed be thy <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> ſéeing that ſhe hath inticed thée to execute ſuch a cruel act and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable déed. Ah Traitor, thou haſt not chaſtiſed the ſhepheard <hi>Alanio,</hi> who unto thy great diſhonour and ſhame, hath diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly haunted and entertained thy wife <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> whom ſhe loveth better then thy ſelf, and yet thou wouldeſt kill &amp; maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre thy owne father, who alwayes hath made great account of thy life, honor and credit. Ah unhappy father! Ah unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate old man! what fault haſt thou committed ſo great, as to be ſlain and murthered by thy ſon? by him whom thou haſt engendred? whom thou haſt brought up and nouriſhed? And for whom thou haſt ſuffered a thouſand troubles? Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heart, ceaſe henceforth to bear him any more love or affection; commit him to the rigor of the law, that he may be puniſhed as he hath deſerved; for if he that hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo execrable an offence eſcape due puniſhment, every diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient child will be emboldened and unfearful, and thine at length will in good earneſt lay hands on thée to ſhorten the courſe of thy odious life.</p>
               <p>Sorrowful and troubled <hi>Filene,</hi> altogether amazed and fearful, hearing his wives voyce, and weighing the horrible treaſon which his ſon had thought to commit upon his perſon became ſo angry, that taking up the dagger which <hi>Lexander</hi> (as I told you) had let fall out of his hand, went forth as ſoon as the day appeared, to aſſemble the Iuſtices of peace and chiefeſt of the Village together in the criminal Court, where he with aboundance of teares flowing out of his eyes, ſpake unto them in this manner.</p>
               <p>I call God to witneſſe (moſt excellent ſhepheards) that I am ſo grieved with that which I am to declare unto you that I greatly fear, leſt my ſpirit and breath faile me before I have opened the matter unto you. Eſpecially ſéeing it is ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:165993:45"/> that I may be eſtéemed moſt cruel, in that I publikely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my ſon, expounding his miſdeeds and wickednes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, which being ſo ſtrange, that I know not how it may be accordingly puniſhed and chaſtiſed, I beſeech you to ſee what is convenient to be done in this caſe, to preſcribe him ſuch and ſo juſt a puniſhment, that other children may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by take a manifeſt example how to behave themſelvs towards their parents. Ye know very well, that I have nouriſhed him carefully, and maintained him as a father ought to do, brought him up painfuly, taught him and inſtructed him, and what trouble, paines, and labour I have had with him, what counſel I continually have given him, and how mildly I have rebuked and chaſtiſed him in his youth. Now is he ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt my will married to the Shepheardeſs <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> and becauſe I have rebuked him, therefore inſtead of revenging himielf on the ſhepheard <hi>Alanio,</hi> who ſhamefully entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as all the Village knoweth) the ſaid <hi>Iſmenia</hi> his wife, he hath turned his rage againſt me, intending to murder me: He found meanes the laſt night to enter into my houſe, yea into my bed-chamber where I lay and ſlept with my wife <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarde,</hi> and there with this ponyard would have ſlain me: and verily had diſpatched me, if God of his grace had not taken his force from him, in ſuch ſort, that he could not hold the dagger in his hand, but was conſtrained to let it fall, and ſo confounded and bereft of his ſences, departed without execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his damnable enterpriſe. And this is it that I had to ſay, thus is the matter verily paſſed, as my beloved ſpouſe can better inform you. But for as much as I certainly know that my ſon <hi>Lexander</hi> had not taken upon him to commit ſuch an horrible treaſon againſt me his father, unleſſe he had been counſelled and provoked thereto by the inticements and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of his wife <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> I beſeech you to perpend and weigh what ought herein to be done, to the end that my ſon may be puniſhed for his offence, and falſe <hi>Iſmenia</hi> alſo, as well for the counſel which ſhe hath given unto her husband, as for her lightneſſe and diſhoneſt love towards <hi>Alanio.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Filene</hi> had ſcarce ended his tale, but the people began to murmure and make ſuch a noyſe, that it ſéemed that the whole Village ſhould have preſently ſunck in the ground; in ſo much that the hearts of all the Shepheards were troubled, and all conceived generally mortal hatred againſt <hi>Lexander.</hi> Some ſaid, that it was pitty he ſhould live till <hi>Phoebus</hi> had reached to his Meridian ſeat; others ſaid, that he ought to be caſt into the River; others, that it was pitty if he were not burned quick; and others, that he ought to be committed to the mercy of the cruel and ſavage beaſts: finally, there was no one perſon that was not ſtirred up againſt him. Beſides, they did likewiſe all marvel of that which <hi>Filene</hi> falſly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged concerning my life; but they were nevertheleſſe all of them ſo amazed at the fact <hi>Lexander,</hi> that they did not greatly hearken to the accuſation and impeachment which <hi>Filene</hi> moſt falſly (by reaſon of <hi>Feliſarde</hi> his wives deceitful ſpéech) had made againſt me.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lexander</hi> had heard what his father had depoſed againſt him, in the Court of criminal cauſe, in the preſence of the Iuſtices and audience of all the people, he was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully grieved; &amp; beſides, when he underſtood what his father had ſaid againſt me, he conceived ſuch excéeding ſorrow, that it paſſeth my ability to expreſs the ſame. And thence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all my grief, thence took my evil it offſpring, that was the cauſe and beginning of all my labours, travel, pain, and ſorrowes. For my dear husband <hi>Lexander,</hi> remembring that in times paſt I did love, &amp; was loved of <hi>Alanio,</hi> and that love forgotten and dead, oftentimes may be renewed and revived again, becauſe he ſaw that the Shepheard <hi>Alanio</hi> (whom I could not abide to ſée, &amp; whom I abhorred for <hi>Lexanders</hi> ſake) was yet amourous of me, daily ſhewing me ſuch curteſies and importunate cheriſhments, he thought verily, and perſwaded himſelf that all was moſt certain and true which his father had ſpoken of me in the face of the world. In ſuch maner, that he diſpairing as well for the treaſon committed unto him by Traitreſs <hi>Sylveria,</hi> as for the ſuſpition which he conceived of
<pb facs="tcp:165993:46"/> me, departed incontinently from the village: ſince which time he was never ſéen there, nor any news brought what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. And as I knew that he was departed, and the cauſe wherefore, by report of certain ſhepheards his friends, (unto whom he had rehearſed the whole matter,) I likewiſe left the village to ſéek him and intend not to reſt any where, untill I find my ſweat ſpouſe, to the end that I may excuſe and clear my ſelf unto him of that fault which is falſly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, and which he ſuſpecteth to be moſt true. It is long ſince I have wandred up and down through the world to ſeek my husband and although I have ſought him and inquired for him in moſt places, and eſpecially all the chiefeſt and principall farmes, houſes, villages, and boroughs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet can I not hear any thing of him. The beſt adventure that I have had in this my endleſſe voyage, was, that two days after I departed from our village, in a certain valley, I met the traitreſſe <hi>Sylveria,</hi> who having heard of the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exile and baniſhment of my husband <hi>Lexander,</hi> went after him to diſcover her treaſon unto him, repenting that ſhe had ſo highly offended him. But ſhe had not as yet found him: and as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe approached near me, and falling fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t on her face, cried me mercy, and at my will, riſing ſhe opened the whole matter vnto me Whereof I was not a little glad, thereby underſtanding how that abhominable treaſon was practiſed againſt us. And although I was but a weak woman yet I could have unlaced the traitreſſe members, and teared her to piece-meal with mine own hands, yet I withheld my ſelf becauſe ſhe onely could remedy my harm, by reporting her own miſchief. I willed her diligently to ſeek my beloved <hi>Lexander,</hi> and to give him notice how all the matter was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and therewith on the ſudden, I left her going one way, and I came anut her, to the end that either of us might find him.</p>
               <p>Thus gentle ſhepheard, have you heard the plain and true rehearſall of all my miſeries and calamities. And for as much as <hi>Phoebus</hi> is not yet drowſie or ſleepy, nor like to reach to his
<pb facs="tcp:165993:46"/> Weſtern bed ſo ſoon: if in like manner you (as I have done) will take pleaſure in reporting the cauſe and off-ſpring of your wandring errors, I doubt not but we ſhall reach to the place (where I hope we ſhall reſt this night) by that time that you have added the cancluſion to your narration. Alas (quoth <hi>Perierio</hi>) the concluſion muſt néeds follow quickly, where the narration is ſooner ended then begun. For all the ſpeciallity that I can uſe in declaring the cauſe of my miſery, is this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule, that I know that I am moſt miſerable. For I love, but whom I know not: and that is all I can ſay concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> hod ſcarce ended his words, but <hi>Iſmenia</hi> made ſign that he ſhould hearken to a certain voice which ſhe thought to Have heard in the woods; for there was a Gentlewoman in the habit of a ſhepheard not far from the place where they were, which thus complained of her miſhap.</p>
               <p>Ah Fortune, have I thus long had thee in eſtimation and yeelded thee ſuch honour; and doeſt thou reward me with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and never ceaſing travel? Ah unthankful and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Goddeſſe! If a Goddeſſe. For Gods are juſt, conſtant, merciful; thou inconſtant, cruel and moſt unjuſt: by the rule of contraries, therefore art thou no Goddeſſe. Ah fooliſh wench be wiſe at laſt being taught by experience, and inſtead of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping fortune, curſe her, deteſt her, and defie her; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelf that the Gods which are jealous, and therefore wrathfull, and incenſed with anger againſt thoſe that deprive them of the honour due unto them, and give unto others have thrown thée into this <hi>Charybdis</hi> of miſeries, to puniſh and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe thy hainous offence committed againſt them in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping that Idoll fortune. Wherefore O heavenly powers, <hi>Briſilla</hi> bendeth her knées and foldeth her hands, asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of heaven for her errour. She repenteth her of her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſhe bewaileth her folly. Pardon mercifull Gods, pardon me, and ceaſe to work your vengeance upon a poor diſtreſſed virgin, that is deſolate and bereft of all hope and conſolation, pleadeth for mercy from heaven. And with that ſhe wept ſo
<pb facs="tcp:165993:47"/> bitterly, that <hi>Iſmenia</hi> and <hi>Perierio</hi> comming unto her could not ſée her face, it was ſo vailed with tears. Likewiſe ſhe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her golden hair, by whole locks off her head with her hands, which were ſo white and ſo delicately faſhioned that it was a marvel to ſée ſuch tender hands ſo cruelly prey upon ſo brave a head. <hi>Iſmenia</hi> therfore not able to behold ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful ſpectacle, ſtepped unto her and held her hands, which ſo furiouſly teared her gliſtering hair, ſaying, Ah diſtreſſed ſhepheardeſs, ſeek not your own ruine, wrong not your ſelf, and fight not againſt your own perſon; for the torment and grief which you ſuffer by reaſon of your misfortune, is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and enlarged, not diminiſhed or ſlacked by theſe meanes.</p>
               <p>Therfore (fair ſhepheardeſs) hold your hands, &amp; ceaſe from vexing your ſelf. You live not alone in adverſity, for we are not ſo happy but that we may worthily complain of Fortunes ſickleneſſe. Company in miſery is no ſmall ſolace comfort your ſelf therefore, and with us hope, that the Gods will at laſt be moved to mercy, and appoint the end of our miſeries. Ah gentle Shepheard (anſwered <hi>Briſilla,</hi> for that was her name) where diſpair ruleth there hope is baniſhed Nay, quoth <hi>Perierio,</hi> embrace hope, and diſpair dareth not approach. The extremity of my caſe (replied <hi>Briſilla</hi>) forbiddeth me to take hold of hope. Yea, but through magnanimity and courage (quoth <hi>Perierio</hi>) may you overcome and vanquiſh your extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. And therfore (ſwéet ſhepheard) let not your heart faint, nor your courage ſlacken, but with an invincible heart ſuffer not any extremity though never ſo ſupream, to brave your mind; and though you be conquered of all your enemies, yet yéeld not the liberty of thy mind to the proudeſt Champion that either Fortune or fate can arme againſt you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Briſilla</hi> marking that both <hi>Perierio</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> were perſons of eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſome of the chiefeſt ſhepheards therabout, &amp; therfore aſſoon as ſhe could contain from wéeping, thanked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their comfortable perſuaſions; for ſhe received great conſolation in that ſhe had met with them taking great
<pb facs="tcp:165993:47"/> delight in beholding their beauty: and asking them whether they travelled, <hi>Iſmenia</hi> told her, that ſhe with <hi>Perierio</hi> were bound toward the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> hoping that the Lady pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the ſame temple would remedy their harm, and give them ſuch inſtruction, that they ſhould have cauſe to hope for the end of their troubles in ſhort time. <hi>Briſilla</hi> hearing that, was paſſing glad, and began to clear her eys from the water which continually ran down her face. And having chaſed away ſuch impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as hindred her ſpeech, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her ſorrow, ſhe ſpake to <hi>Perierio</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> with ſuch an excellent grace, that her words ſeemed to flow from her mouth, as running water iſſueth out of the fountain. Inſomuch that they did not doubt, but that ſhe was ſome courtly Princeſſe, though ſhe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her body with the veſture of a country laſſe.</p>

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this <hi>Exordium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Loving ſhepheards, though I fear that I ſhall not be able to accompliſh that accordingly, which I have undertaken to do, miſtruſting that I ſhall both lack time to end the hiſtory of my life, when I have begun it, &amp; alſo diſcretion to contrive the ſame into ſome order and method my memory being weak by reaſon whereof, I may chance to forget, and ſlip over many things; yet hoping that you will accept of my good will and readineſſe in pleaſuring you, I will endeavour as neare as I can, and as truly as my memory will permit, to
<pb facs="tcp:165993:48"/> report and lay down the whole circumſtance of my caſe unto you.</p>
               <p>I was borne in the famous Iſle of <hi>Albion,</hi> where my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was generall Commander over all the Kings Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad when the King was at home. And if his Majeſty chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to follow the Camp in his proper perſon then was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viceroy and ſupream Governor at home I had not lived ſix years, but my father venturing himſelf in the midſt of his enemies, and preſſing into the very bowells of their Camp, ſlew the King of <hi>Gaule</hi> with his own hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with gave the enemy a terrible overthrow, and his King a great victory, but it coſt him his life. For after he had ſlaine the King, there were ſo many Knights that beſought him to revenge the death of their King that he was not able to eſcape the hour which his deſtinies had appointed him.</p>
               <p>When the King was informed how that my father had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him ſuch a wonderful victory with the price of his life, knew not whether he had greater cauſe to rejoyce for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of his enemy, or to wéep for the loſs of ſuch a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier, and faithful ſubject. Wherefore he in proper perſon came to my fathers Palace, and himſelf brought my Mother the newes of my Fathers honourable death, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us all with ſuch friendly ſpéeches, that we could not have béene grieved for his death, if Nature had not forced us to lament his loſſe. Yet howſoever we were grieved, the King cauſed my Father to be buried moſt honourably, and erected ſuch a magnificent Tombe at his owne coſt, that he gave a ſufficient Token to all his Countrey, how greatly he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of Duke <hi>Florindo,</hi> (for ſo was he called.) With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foure yeares after, my Mother the Ducheſſe, being an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged woman dyed, and was buried under the ſame Tombe with my Father. And the King conſidering that I was young (about ten yeares of age) and that I was onely heire to the Dukedome, to the end that I might be carefully brought up and well looked unto, he cauſed me to be brought to the Court, where I waighted on the Quéen, who made as
<pb facs="tcp:165993:48"/> great account of me as if I had been her daughter. And to the end that I might perceive the love and affection ſhe and her husband the King did bear me, I was honoured with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Ducheſſe, and diſpoſer of all my fathers ſigniores, and Lordſhips, yea &amp; of the Dukedom alſo, at mine own pleaſure: neither did the King withhold from me any part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues thereof; ſo that I lived in as great joy as any mortal maid might; for I wanted nothing that I was able to think of. I was loved and favoured both of the King and Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en, and therefore honoured of all the country. But alack, this my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity was too great to be perpetuall; and I was ſeated too high to eſcape the ſtormy blaſts of adverſity. The tall Oaks are ſhaken with the winds, and the climing ſtéeples rent with the thunder clap, where the low brambles féel not the fury of the wind, nor the baſe cottage the force of the ſtorm. The tops of high mountains are chopped through <hi>Apollos</hi> heat, where the low plains and green medows are beautified with flowers, and being cheriſhed with <hi>Phoebus</hi> rays, produce ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo poor <hi>Briſilla</hi> lifted up to high eſtate, triumphing in Court, and glorying in her happineſſe; is brought in this moſt miſerable torment, whereas many ſimple maids and countrey wenches injoy ſweet content, and paſſe their lives in ſupream plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. You ſhall therefore underſtand (loving ſhepheards) that I being 15 years of age or thereabout, the young prince was ſent for by the King from the Vniverſity; for the Qeen had purpoſed to marry me unto him Who being about eight or ten moneths younger then my ſelf, was thought too young to be married ſo ſoon; but the Queen fearing leaſt ſome one or other (for there was many noble mens ſons of great hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and high deſcent in the Court) ſhould win my heart and love, uſed the matter ſo, that few or none could have my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but her ſon, whom ſhe wiſhed to be matched with none but my ſelf. And in truth by reaſon of our daily converſation at length grew ſuch familiarity and acquaintance between <hi>Periander</hi> and me, that love creeping into our hearts united
<pb facs="tcp:165993:49"/> us together, and of two bodies made but one heart, one will, one deſire, one pleaſure, and one mind. Inſomuch that the Queen, yea and all the Court, began to perceive the affection that we did bear one to another. Suppoſe (ſhepheards) what a pleaſure it was both to the King, his wife, and moſt of all the noblemen of the realm, yea generally to all men in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſee ſuch likelihood of a marriage, which they ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſhed and greedily deſired. And dy that time that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> had reached to the age of eighteen years, the King fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt delay might breed danger, and my affection to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge or his ſons mind alter, called us both into his chamber and in preſence of the Queen his wife ſpake unto us after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, intending to try our conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Marvell not my ſon <hi>Periander,</hi> nor you young Duches, that I have ſent for you hither, for I will not keep cloſe the cauſe thereof. Know therefore that my pleaſure is, that you <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> love not Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> any longer; have I ſent for you from the Vniverſity to court your mothers maids? Did I cal you to the Court to learn how to play <hi>Mars</hi> in the field, and do you take upon you ſo young, to ſerve <hi>Venus</hi> in the chamber, you are but a boy yet <hi>Periander,</hi> and therefore unfit for love. And you Lady <hi>Briſill,</hi> have we ſhewed you ſuch friendly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the Court, and honored you with ſuch an high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to allure our ſon to fancy you, where I purpoſed to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> eldeſt daughter, &amp; heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the crown of <hi>Portugal?</hi> thy father the deceaſed Duke, was a man of great deſert, but his daughter not ſo worthy as to become a Queen. Be contented with the title of a Ducheſs Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> and reach not ſo high a bough as a crown; for thou mayeſt both miſſe of thy purpoſe, and incur danger to loſe their favour, in whom conſiſteth your welfare. Therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you both to leave theſe familiar meetings, theſe lovely <hi>Salves,</hi> which you give one to another in the morning, &amp; curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good nights you bid one another in the evening; alſo thoſe pleaſant ſmiles, paſſionate looks and continual winks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you favour one an other, will I have you not to uſe any
<pb facs="tcp:165993:49"/> longer. And to be ſhort, I forbid you to uſe company one with the other any more. <hi>Periander</hi> hearing his father concluded ſo peremptory againſt his bliſs, anſwered. Then father, my Lord and Soveraign if it pleaſe your Majeſty to ſeperate me from the converſation of Duches <hi>Briſil,</hi> I beſeech you to give me leave to ſeparate my ſelf from the company of all men; and with that he drew his dagger, and would have wounded his loving heart with the ſharp point thereof, had not his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Quéen hindred his intent, holding his arme. As for me, I was ſo perplexed both at the Kings words and his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I fell on the ground in ſuch manner, that the king himſelf thinking that I had been dead, ran from his chair of eſtate, and lifted me from the ground, calling Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> ſpeak, ſpeak Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> young Queen of <hi>Albion,</hi> ſpeak but one word. But I lay in that extaſie a good hour. All which time the King, the Queen, and all that were preſent, (but eſpecially <hi>Periander</hi>) were ſo grieved that none of them could abſtain from wéeping. The King called, the Quéen hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mine eares, with a lamentable voyce, and <hi>Periander</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breathleſs, being choaked with excéeding ſorrow which he conceived, could neither call, nor cry. At length with much ado, I came to my ſelf, and ſtood upright, to the joy of all thoſe that had heard of my miſchance. Whereupon the King told us that he had uſed his formor words, but to learne whether our love was firm, intending if I liked of <hi>Periander,</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> of me, as of man and wife, to marry us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To be ſhort, before we departed from the King, he ſent for ſome of the chiefeſt Noblemen, and in their preſence, <hi>Periander</hi> made promiſe never to marry other woman then my ſelf, and in like manner affirmed that I was content to have him to my husband, and would die rather then be married to any other. So that our marriage was preſently concluded, and the wedding to be a month after.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. How <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> betrayed the Prince <hi>Periander,</hi> and ſold him to the <hi>Moores</hi> for a Gally-ſlave, and the ſorrow that was made for his abſence.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Magine, loving Shepheards, what joy there was through the country, when it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the young Prince and the yong Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were promiſed, and ſhould be maried within the ſpace of one month? Conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, how happy and bleſſed that <hi>Periander</hi> and I thought our ſelves to be, when we had obtaind that with the King and Queens conſent and good will, which we feared that they would never have granted? but envy the ſoreſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that wageth warre againſt content, ſoon made a breach of our felicity, into a woful and pitiful miſhap.</p>
               <p>For there was a young Knight in the Court called ſir <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicourt,</hi> being ſon to the Earle <hi>Doraſter,</hi> who was ſo in love with me (though he had not as yet declared it to me) that for me he had willingly made exchange of all that he had. This Sir <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> having of the contract between us, took it ſo heavily, that he almoſt diſpaired. But conſidering that grief or ſorrow could not prevail to remedy his harm, took courage, and hoped to find means by ſubtilty and craft to hinder the marriage, which he practiſed with all ſpeed. The Earl his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Admiral of the ſea, by means whereof, this young Knight had great acquaintance with divers Captains of the ſhips of war, and other Pilots and ſhipmaſters: among whom he had one eſpecially bound unto him named <hi>Barſalis,</hi> whoſe ſervice he durſt imploy in the weightieſt matter of the world, and unto whom he might have communicated the chiefeſt ſecrets he had.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, he ſent for this <hi>Barſalis</hi> and told him, that if ever he would requite the courteſies and friendſhip which he
<pb facs="tcp:165993:50"/> had received of him, that now the time was come, and occaſion offered, wherein he might ſhew the thankfulneſs and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his mind. The Captain Pilot anſwered, that he wiſhed not for any better hour then that in which he might be imployed in his ſervice, proteſting, that whatſoever he would have him do, he ſhould find him moſt ready to execute his pleaſure were it right or not, ſo it conſiſted in his power, being ready to hazard his life to do him ſervice; whereupon Sir <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> deſired him to cauſe a ſhip to be well rigged and furniſhed with proviſion, and to lay Anchor at the haven of <hi>Dover,</hi> where he ſhould expect his comming, and then he ſhould further underſtand his pleaſure. Which <hi>Barſalis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, though he wiſt not why, nor to what end. For Sir <hi>Maſsicourt</hi> being ſomething politick, and conſidering that mens mindes are fickle, and ſubject to alteration, would not as yet diſcloſe his intent unto the Pilot, fearing leaſt he might have been moved to bewray him before the time that he purpoſed to execute his treaſon. But after he had charged the Pilot to expect his comming to the Haven of <hi>Dover,</hi> he ſought occaſion to talk with the young Prince as ſoon as he might. And the next morning having heard that <hi>Periander</hi> intended to ride a hunting, prepared himſelf, to méet the Prince as he rode towards the Park. <hi>Periander</hi> glad of his company (for there was great familiarity between them) and ſir <hi>Maſsicourt</hi> was wonderfully well beloved of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be merry with him, and to talk with him according to his accuſtomed manner. At length ſir <hi>Maſsicourt</hi> taking occaſion to ſpeak of the Sea, I remember (quoth he) that your Grace oftentimes hath been earneſt with me to go to Sea, and to ſee what rule <hi>Neptune</hi> kéepeth in his kingdome. The weather is now moſt pleaſant for that purpoſe, inſomuch that if it will pleaſe your Grace now to recreate your ſelf in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſuch pleaſure as the calme Sea can yield, I am ready to accompany your Grace to <hi>Dover,</hi> where I have a moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Pinnace, as excellent and fit for our turne as any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in all the Realme. <hi>Periander</hi> thanked him, and appointed
<pb facs="tcp:165993:51"/> to ride with him the next morrow towards the haven. As ſoon as he came to the Court, he told us that he had purpoſed to go to Sea, and asked me whether I would give him leave to be away five or ſix dayes. And although I was very ſorry and unwilling that he ſhould go, fearing leſt any miſchance might happen unto him, yet ſeeing he ſo deſired to go, I ſeemed to be more willing then I was, left he ſhould be grieved, and leave his pleaſure for feare of diſpleaſing me.</p>
               <p>The next morning ſir <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> being come, their faſt broken, and their horſe ready, they rode merrily from the Court; but alas, I was not without cauſe diſcomforted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I forecaſt ſuch danger as hapned in vain; for the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Maſſicourt,</hi> as ſoon as the Prince was aboord the Pinnace, called the Pilot <hi>Barſalis</hi> aſide, and gave him certain chaines of gold and other ſumptuous jewels, mounting to the value of ten thouſand crowns, promiſing him a far better reward. And this is it I requeſt at your hands (quoth he) that when we be on the ſea (ſéeing the wind ſerveth for <hi>Spain</hi>) you ſhould faile into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſea, and being there, on the ſudden lay hold on the Prince, and my ſelf alſo, as if you were enraged againſt us, and ſought to bereave us both of our lives. That done, you ſhall hide me into ſome odde corner of the Ship, where the Prince ſhall not be able to ſée me, and make him beléeve that you have caſt me into the Sea and then arriving at ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> haven, ſell him to the Moors that have the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Gallies, to be a Gally-ſlave, but firſt put off his clothes, and apparel him as if he were one of the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes; then ſhall we be rid of him, and he never like to eſcape out of their hands. <hi>Barſalis</hi> promiſed to do all this, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no leſs indeed. For <hi>Periander</hi> was ſold unto the Galley ſlaves, ſir <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> travelled into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis</hi> upon a certain night, ſet his Pinace on fire, and burned all his Mariners, ſaving himſelf in a Ship boat, and in a Merchants he returned to <hi>Albion.</hi> Whither being arrived, he came preſently to the Court and brought us newes of thoſe that we ſo long had wiſhed to hear of. For they had bin
<pb facs="tcp:165993:51"/> away ten moneths, and though the King had ſent out divers Ships, and the Admiral himſelf alſo courſed through the ſeas, yet could we hear nothing either of the Kings or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals ſonne. Whereby we ſuppoſed that they were dead, though we hoped the contrary. But <hi>Barſalis</hi> that traitrous Pilot told us, that as ſoon as they had entred the mouth of the Sea, the winde roſe, and ſuch a tempeſt was ſpread over all the Sea, that the Pinnace being beaten with the waves on every ſide, rent in pieces and ſunck preſently. All that he could ſay of <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Maſſicourt,</hi> was, that he ſaw them both together leap out of the Pinnace, and that the Knight with a ſmall maſt in his hands ſwome up and down whither the ſtreame drove him, and that the Prince caſting himſelf upon one of the hatches, toſſed up and down the waves. All the reſt that were in the Ship, he ſaid that they ſunck with the Pinace, and himſelf eſcaped alone in the Ship-boat. This traytor <hi>Barſalis</hi> received no ſmall gift of the King and of me, (although his newes was ſo evil) becauſe he told us that he ſaw the Prince fléeting up and downe the waves upon one of the ſhip-hatches, hoping that he was ſomewhere caſt on land, though perhaps ſo far that he could not ſo ſoon return home to <hi>Albion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not hear make mention what a living death or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life I poor wretch led, all the while that <hi>Periander</hi> was abſent, ſometimes perſwading my ſelf that he was dead, and ſometimes hoping to ſee him and injoy his preſence; but this I will leave to your diſcretion (loving ſhepheards,) and paſſe on forwards in the declaration of this lamentable hiſtory. You ſhall therefore know, that after <hi>Barſalis</hi> had been ſix moneths at home, the Admirals ſon returned to his fathers houſe attired like a ſhip ſlave, and told us ſuch a tale of his wonderfull adventure, how he was caſt on the ſhore ſide with his maſt-piece, and how he fared on the land, that not the Court onely, but all the Country alſo admired at his hard fortune.

And as for my ſelfe, though I was very ſorry for her death, yet was the grief and pain which I ſuffered for the abſence of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi> ſo great and excéeding, that I could ſcarce think up-any other thing, and therefore the ſooner forgate the death of the Quéen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this time began the traitor <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> to make love unto me, and to caſt ſuch paſſionate looks upon me, at all times that he paſſed by me, or came into the place where I was, that I could not chuſe but perceive that he was becom darling to <hi>Venus,</hi> by the forcing dart of her Son <hi>Cupid,</hi> and that he ſuffered great pain for my ſake.</p>
               <p>I was ſorry for his caſe, becauſe he was a moſt gallant Gentleman, excéeding both in perfection of body and readines of wit, but yet my hart was ſo fixed on <hi>Periander,</hi> that although I had certainly known that he was dead, yet could I not have forgotten him to love any other. Yet howſoever I was affected, <hi>Maſsicourt</hi> found meanes to enter into the Orchard.
<pb facs="tcp:165993:52"/> I being there alone, and emboldned himſelf ſo far, that he came unto me, gréeted me, and with all humility, by word of mouth declared what torment he ſuffered for love of me, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to be merciful unto him. Whereunto I anſwered, that I could ſhew him mercy in pittying his caſe, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to change his mind, but other mercy I could not ſhew him, and ſo I flung into the Palace and left him among the trées, which might have been witneſſes of the teares he ſhead. Yet he gave not over the field for all he had had but ill ſucceſſe at the firſt aſſault, and purpoſed to ſend me a Letter, hoping that ink and paper would do more then his bare words had done. Eſpecially becauſe he being paſſionate, was not able in my preſence to expreſſe his mind, neither would I hearken unto his ſpeech. Inſomuch that he thinking that I could not do leſſe then read all whatſoever he wrote, though I could not give ear to his ſayings; diſpatched a Letter and conveyed it into my hands as ſecretly as he could: which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was written to ſuch an end.</p>

You can teach me that mercy beſeemeth maids, but you forget in the mean time, that Knights ought not to be unmerciful as to ſeek the overthrow of our honeſty, and to ſpoil us of our honour.

At length (when I thought ſurely that I had been altogether rid of ſuch a troubleſome ſutor) on the ſudden he greeted me upon a certain morning, being but newly riſen. And although I was alone, yet I was ſo angry, that <hi>I</hi> turned my face from him, and would not ſpeak unto him. This happened (to my remembrance) twice or thrice, after which time <hi>I</hi> ſaw him no more. But about thrée weeks after, a little casket covered with a cloth of gold was brought me, whereon there was written this inſcription in golden letters.</p>

                  <l>This do, and let the colour of thy coat,</l>

               <p>In what caſe I was (loving ſhepheards) after I had read that meſſage and béen informed of that rufull tragedy, I will not now declare.</p>
               <p>For the ſorrow which I conceived for the end of <hi>Maſſicourt,</hi> was incredible. Beſides what a ſuddain rumor was ſpread through the Court of his death you may conſider, inſomuch that I need not to ſtand upon that point. But I will paſſe on to the reſt of my miſery. For within thrée or four moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:165993:54"/> the deceaſe of ſir <hi>Maſſicourt,</hi> I got a ſtronger enemy to my content then <hi>Maſſicourt;</hi> for the King himſelf (though he was above fifty years of age) ſolicited me to give over all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his ſon, and yéeld to his requeſt, which was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his wife, and be crowned with the diadem of <hi>Albion.</hi> Yet could not that precious object alter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of <hi>Briſil,</hi> or any whit in her diminiſh the memory of <hi>Periander.</hi> But the King knowing that he might command, when he perceived that I could not be induced by prayers, fair words, lofty promiſes, and other allurements to grant his ſute, ſoon uſed the tyranous ſentence of all thoſe that may do what they will.</p>
               <q>Sic volo, ſic jubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</q>
               <p>And thought to try whether he could by threatnings and menaces obtain that, which by fair means I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto: but all could not help, for except death onely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could take from me that faith and promiſe which I made to <hi>Periander.</hi> And whileſt the King &amp; I thus ſtrove, he in loving, &amp; I in hating a letter was brought to the Court from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein he informed the King that his ſon <hi>Periander</hi> was with him intending to be in <hi>Albion</hi> with his father and loving <hi>Briſil</hi> very ſhortly. But that he had ſent a meſſenger before his coming, that they ſhould be informed of his health and fortune, could ſcarce believe it; but that they ſaw it was manifeſt, ſéeing the Prince <hi>Periander</hi> had written that <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> was by the Pylot <hi>Barſalis</hi> caſt over-board, and yet notwithſtanding he complained not of <hi>Barſalis,</hi> but agréed with him in the report of the tempeſt which was none. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that love which he bore me was ſufficient proof of his treaſon. For he ſent us the whole declaration of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon practiſed by <hi>Barſalis</hi> againſt him. He alſo informed us how he had heard of the Quéen his mothers death, whereof he was very ſorry. The King having received theſe Letters, at the firſt was glad that his ſon was living, and cauſed <hi>Barſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> to be apprehended, who with a little racking confeſſed the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:55"/> whole matter, and appeached the Admirals ſon that was dead, as the Author and cauſe of all that he had executed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the whole world ſo marvelled, that they could ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it. And whereas many had pitied the Knights lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and tragical end, now they judged him rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſerts. And I for my part, was ſo inraged againſt him, that if he had yet lived. I beleeve I had with my owne hands wrung his head from his ſhoulders; for he was the cauſe of all my calamities. The King cauſed <hi>Barſalis</hi> to be hanged and quartered, and in the place where <hi>Maſsicourt</hi> that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick traytor was buried, did he command a gibbet to be ſet up reaching over his Tombe, and this written on the top of it in great letters,
<q>
                     <l>Here lieth entomb'd a Knight of ancient fame,</l>
                     <l>An Earls ſon, Sir <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> by name.</l>
                     <l>This Knight, for love, an heinous treaſon tri'd;</l>
                     <l>Yet could not help, he pierc'd his heart and di'd.</l>
                     <l>He was no traitor known till clad in clay,</l>
                     <l>This Gibbet here was ſet it to bewray.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For the King was terribly enraged, when he had heard this ſtrange kind of treaſon: which was the cauſe that now he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her whom he had wedded to his ſon; and hated him whom he was by Nature bound to love.</p>
               <p>For leſt <hi>Periander</hi> ſhould return into <hi>Albion,</hi> and marry with me, whom he would have to be his wife, the King forgetting both the law of Nature and Honeſty wrote unto the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that his Son <hi>Periander</hi> was guilty of treaſon againſt his own perſon, being his Father: and therefore deſired him upon all friendſhip, and the alliance that had a long time béen between the Kingdomes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Albion,</hi> to keep his ſon cloſe priſoner, and to let him be uſed as hardly as any of all the other Captives which were in his Kingdome or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>When I had heard what anſwer the King had returned by
<pb facs="tcp:165993:55"/> the Embaſſadors of <hi>Spain,</hi> my heart was ready to burſt. And I was minded divers times to diſpatch my ſelf with one of my garters, thinking that by my death I ſhould deliver <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> from impriſonment, and move the Kings mind to uſe his ſon as he ought to do. But I know not how, I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo falſly allured with hope, that I continually abſtained from ſhortening my life, and thereby prolonged my miſery. You ſhall therefore underſtand, that I got one of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors Pages to carry a Letter from me unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and to deliver it ſecretly into his own hands; which the youth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he would accompliſh, though it ſhould coſt him his life: and to reward his readineſſe, and to make him the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger and carefuller to diſcharge his duty, I gave him twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie crowns to drink. The Letter was written to this effect.</p>

               <p>This Letter I had no ſooner delivered to the Page, but Embaſſadours departed from the Court having taken their leave of the King, and embarked themſelves the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to return into <hi>Spain.</hi> When they were gone the King ſent for me, and asked me whether I was not yet reſolved to love him ſéeing he hated his own ſon for love of me.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O compaſs the concluſions of my intent, leſt I ſhould ſeem penſive or ſorrowful, I wept all night, to the end mine eyes might ſpare from ſhedding tears in the day. Beſides I ſéemed to be very buſie in beautifying my perſon with ſumptuous clothes, coſtly jewels, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearls, and other ornaments which I had laid aſide ſithence the loſſe of <hi>Periander.</hi> At laſt, about a week before the prefixed time of our marriage, I eſpied an occaſion to get out of the Court, which though it was not ſo fit as I could wiſh, yet fearing leſt if I did let that ſlip, I ſhould not have the like offered the day being ſo neer at hand, I took hold of it, which was this. There was a ſhip that ſix weeks before, had brought ſugar, figs, raiſons, dates, oranges and lemons, to <hi>Albion,</hi> the Merchants whereof, having bought other wares to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> had made their proviſion to go to Sea. Which when I heard, (for I was in nothing ſo attentive as to learn of ſome Back that was bound toward <hi>Caſtile</hi>) I changed my ſex in outward ſight, and in the form of a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:57"/> I went to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants, and beſéeched them to take me into their ſervice, for I was a poor fatherleſs childe that had for the ſpace of two years led a Mariners life; which miſliked me ſo, (for that I was weak of conſtitution, and my limbs tender by nature) that I have taken leave of the Maſter of the Ship, wherein I have ſerved to ſée if I could happen into ſome other kind of good ſervice. The Merchants no doubting my tale to be other then truth, becauſe I ſpake <hi>Spaniſh</hi> unto them, ſuppoſing that I had learned their ſpeech by travelling into their Country, liked me ſo well, that they went to Mumbchance which of them ſhould be my Maſter. Whereof I was ſo glad, that ſéeing the Mariners hoyſe up the ſailes, and hale in the Anchor cable, I cared not for the chance of the Die, or whoſe ſervant I ſhould be, hoping that if the Gods would favor us with a gale of wind that I ſhould ſhortly arrive to the place where the ſtay of my life, and hold of my hope remained. But mark the taunting check which Fortune gave me. For we had ſcarce entred the mouth of the Sea, but we were overtaken by two ſwift Pinnaces, ſo well furniſhed with all warlike proviſion, that they had been able to maſter four ſuch Barks as the Merchants ſhip where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were. To be ſhort, that they calling to our Pilot that he ſhould ſtrike, durſt not but obey; and I miſdoubting that they were <hi>Albion</hi> ſhips, ſent to look after me, kept my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhip hatches, where I ſo bepitched and betarred my face, that the judgement of the eye could not prevail to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern who I was, if I might have eſcaped ſpeaking. But the Pilot who could not underſtand the <hi>Albion</hi> ſpéech, called me to interpret what the <hi>Albion</hi> Pilot dem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>anded of him. But I made as if I had been ſo affraid that I could not ſpeak, and while I heard them wrangling each in his own language, one nothing underſtanding the other, I tried to counterfeit my voyce as well as I ceuld, fearing leſt I ſhould have been compelled at length to become their interpriter, which in truth ſo happened. For the Merchant my Maſter conſidering the courſe of our Navigation, was greatly hindred by their
<pb facs="tcp:165993:58"/> importunity, and fearing leſt they were Pirates and thought to pilfer and rob the Bark, and ſpoile him and the other Merchants of their goods and lives, forced me to come to the uper part of the ſhip, and to ſpeak to my Country-men. Thus I conſtrained whether I would or no, not onely to preſent my ſelf unto them that ſought me (for I had heard what they demanded, though none could underſtand them but my ſelf, and therefore I was the better inſtructed what to ſay unto them, and how I ſhould interpret their ſayings unto the Spaniard) but alſo to bewray my voyce unto them, and to bee the expounder that ſhould declare and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what they demanded, and what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> anſwered. Wherefore being come into their preſence, I began to ſpeak <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> but that in ſuch order that they had much add to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me, and took more pleaſure to laugh at me, then to enquire after <hi>Briſil,</hi> whom the fools ſpake with, and thought that ſhe had been ſome <hi>Moor</hi> or <hi>Turk.</hi> For the Admiral who was there in his own proper perſon, hearing how crabbedly I cracked his <hi>Brittiſh</hi> language on the pate; what the devill (quoth he) have the Gods ſent us hither, to mock us with our language after this ſort. No doubt but our paines are well beſtowed to come thus far into the Sea, to talk with ſuch an eloquent fellow. I beleeve certainly, that he hath been an Orator to the Devil three or four years. Whereupon he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me what Countrey man I was, a Turk or a Iew? I anſwered him that <hi>I</hi> was which he would, for <hi>I</hi> knew not my ſelf where <hi>I</hi> was born. At length he asked me where <hi>I</hi> had learned to ſpeak ſuch good <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> whereunto <hi>I</hi> made as if <hi>I</hi> had not marked that he mocked and gybed with me, ſaid, that when <hi>I</hi> was two or three years old <hi>I</hi> was in <hi>Albion</hi> with my mother, for the ſpace of two or three years or thereabout, in which time <hi>I</hi> learned ſo much of their language, that God be thanked it ſerveth my turn. Whereat they all burſt forth, and laughed very heartily, and at length, remembring <hi>Briſil,</hi> they asked me whether our Bark was bound? and <hi>I</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Barbary;</hi> then they asked whether we had not any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:165993:58"/> paſſengers aboord, I anſwered, that we had no more then they ſaw, either men or women. They ſaid they were not ſo content, but would ſearch the Ship, and bade me to tell the Pilot that he ſhould not reſiſt their pleaſure, for they would do it and were forced to do it by the ſtraight command of their King. Whereupon I told our Pilot this tale, that they were the King of <hi>Albions</hi> ſearchers, that ſcoured up and down the Seas, to ſee if they could meet with any Ship that carried ſuch wares out of the countrey as were not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or licenced by the king; and that becauſe they ſuſpected that the Merchants that were in that Ship had unpriviledged wares, they would for that purpoſe make ſearch for them, and if they found none, they would not any longer hinder them of their undertaken voyage. The Pilot willingly let them come aboord the Bark, though the Merchants thought verily that they had been Pyrates, and uſed that colour to obtaine their prey the eaſier. But they found themſelves deceived, for after the <hi>Albion</hi> Lords had throughly ſearched the Ship, they returned into their Pinace again, without offering the leaſt injury in the world to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereof they were glad, and I gladder, having eſcaped the danger which Fortune ſeemed to threaten me. And in few dayes after, being ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived at the wiſhed Haven, my Maſter took poſt horſe for himſelf and me, and we rode to <hi>Sivil,</hi> in which City my <hi>Periander</hi> lay impriſoned. And now I began to wiſh my ſelf releaſed from the ſubjection of my Maſter, for he imployed me in ſo many matters that I could not perform my duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him accordingly, and withall have time and occaſion to obtain my deſire concerning <hi>Periander;</hi> wherefore I ſought all means poſſible to be rid of my Maſter, who was loth to part from me. At length I feined my ſelf to be ſick, that I could neither eat nor drink, nor ſtand on my feet, but kept my bed, and being asked by him what I ailed, or what ſickneſs I had, I made as if I durſt not tell him, at length ſeeing he was ſo importunate to know, I told him it was the plague, whereof he was ſo affraid, that he would put me into an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb facs="tcp:165993:59"/> among the diſeaſed; but I intreated him that he would rather leave me to mine own ſhift, then to place me among the diſeaſed, promiſing that if I eſcaped death, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into his ſervice before any other. And though he was loth to let me go where I ſhould want looking unto, yet ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had rather have died then be carried to an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, he gave me thrée or four pieces of gold and ſent me pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wiſhing that I might fare well. I thanked him for his kindneſs, and the Gods for my liberty. And now I began marvellouſly to long for the ſight of my onely comfort <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who little knew that I was ſo neer him. But I could ſcarce imagine how I might come to him, and avoid all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition. For I feared leſt the King ſhould have miſdoubted of my intent, and therefore have written unto the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to make ſearch whether I were in his countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, but eſpecially to watch whether any came unto <hi>Periander,</hi> knowing that if I were in <hi>Spain</hi> it was to come to him. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, made me ſo carefull and ſo wary that I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before I leaped, and did nothing but being forethought; So that I paſſed by the priſon where <hi>Periander</hi> lay every day once or twice, and ſometimes more often, to ſee what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was that I might come néer him. I eſpied the manner of the priſon, the condition of the Gaolor the eſtate of thoſe that frequented his company. At length I became ſo impatient, that I could not abide any longer delay and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to invent ſome deceit or other to beguile the kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and come to the ſpéech of <hi>Periander.</hi> Firſt I purpoſed to apparel my ſelf like ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, and ſo to have asked the Gaolor leave to ſpeak unto the <hi>Albion</hi> Prince, but that ſéemed not the ſafeſt way. Afterwards, I thought to go like a <hi>Brittiſh</hi> beggar; thinking that they would have brought me to talk with the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Prince, to take pleaſure at our ſtrange parley. And this liked me worſe, for ſo I might have eaſily béen entrapped. At laſt I found no better meanes then to counterfeit my ſelf to be an Egyptian Prophet and Fortune-teller. So that I went into the ſtréet where the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:59"/> priſon ſtood and a good way off (as I had not thought to come néer the priſon) I began to ſing an Egyptian enchantment, and I did ſo counterfet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I, as cunningly as I could, held the devill a candle, and told them many good morrowes, and evil even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as <hi>I</hi> often have heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Egyptian figure <hi>Caſtres</hi> uſed to do, to deceive the world; yet nevertheles I uſed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo that they were content of their fortune, and liked me the better. But I was ſo haled and pulled from one place to another, that I knew not how I might content them all. At length I was fetched by the Maids that dwelt with the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and his daughters to come thither, whither I went wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, for that was my cauſe of my practiſed ſorcery, and there was the man whoſe fortune made me become a fortune-teller. To be ſhort, the Maids of the houſe led me into a yard where they might ſecretly talk with me, and ask me queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning their fortunes. But it chanced that my good hap was ſuch, that I eſpied <hi>Periander</hi> out of a window reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the yard where we were; but alack I ſpied that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned mirrour of beauty, fair <hi>Florina,</hi> the daughter of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtanding by him, who entangled in the ſnare of fancy, and fettered in the pleaſant contemplation of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> beauty ſo loved him that ſhe corrupted the Gaolor with ſums of money to uſe her Love, not as a ſtrange priſoner, but rather as a worthy gueſt whom ſhe alſo in proper perſon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſited to aſſwage his ſorrow; which ſight ſo amazed me that I could not tel what I ſaid to the Maids deſirous to know their fortune. I felt a kind of ſoothing pleaſure créep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veins of my heart, for the preſence of my friend, &amp; on the other ſide, a fearful kind of grief poſſeſſed my ſoul, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd, what Fortune ſhe had; and was like to have. Imagine (gentle ſhepheards) what mind I had either to tell her fortune, or to give her an anſwer being in that caſe; yet taking all the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that in ſuch extremity could cleave to my heart. I ſaid, My skill is too ſmall to conjecture of ſo high conſtellations; for I hold opinion that the deſtinies of thoſe that are of ſuch noble deſcent as your ſelf, are more intricate then the conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of baſe perſons; and therefore if my divinations prove falſe or little agréeing to the truth, I leave your Grace to be burdened with the blame, ſéeing it is your pleaſure that I ſhould conjecture of your luck, and not my own preſumption: And therefore thus much I wil ſay of your fortune, I wil not touch your Parentage, wealth, honor, and likelihood of great renown, for that is known to all the world, but I wil tel you of that which is moſt doubtful, and more delightful unto you, as my ſimple knowledge teacheth me; for (unleſs I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) you love (Lady) and that moſt loyally, but I ſée one doubt which is like to redound to your ſorrow, that you ſhall have a ſhrewd enemy to your deſire, and a terrible foe to your wiſhed love. And to yield you reaſon of my divination, mark the line of affection in your hand, it is ſtreight, a token of pure love, and faithful affection accompanied with loyalty,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:60"/> and theſe two ſhort wrinkles which you ſee of each ſide of the forſaid line, are token of the croſs you are like to indure in obtaining you hearts eaſe. Neither would I have your grace to think that the clauſe of this ill ſucceſs dependeth onely on the perſon who hath your heart in hold; for there be many events and chances that we cannot foreknow or forethink, which may breed your ſorrow. But hoping that your Grace is minded as the Aſtrologian that ſaid, <hi>Inclinationes non ſunt edicta praetorum,</hi> that inclinations be not ordinances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Maiors; ſhall be able to command the ſtars and rule over them, according to that old ſaying, <hi>Sapiens hominabiter aſtris,</hi> I am glad thou takeſt me to be ſo wiſe Egyptian, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Florina.</hi> But I pray thee canſt thou not tell me more particularly of ſome adventure to come? No truly Madam (quoth I) may it pleaſe your Grace to bear with my rudeneſs and ignorance, which is not able to content your pleaſure, and ſatisfie your mind concerning this point. Why then, quoth ſhe, let me know what you can ſay to this Gentleman, for I hope as I admitted him to hear my luck ſo he will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry if I hear his fortune. But <hi>Periander,</hi> (as I well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) knew me; for I ſaw his face receive ſuch divers colors, and his countenance altered ſo ſuddenly, that <hi>Florina</hi> marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what had befallen unto him, that he ſtood ſo perplexed; for he conceived infinite pleaſure in ſéeking his onely joy ſo néer him and contrarily he was grieved that I found him with <hi>Florina,</hi> fearing leſt I ſhould ſuſpect him leſs conſtant, and ſo my ſelf leſs faithful. <hi>Florina</hi> beholding <hi>Periander,</hi> wiſt not what to ſay, and although I was ſorry to ſee him in that taking, yet becauſe I knew the occaſion and reaſon thereof, I was the better contented, hoping that it was no more then I thought it to be, and that he was led in a trance by my unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected preſence. Yet I was commanded by <hi>Florina</hi> to depart, ſhe thinking it now no time to tell any more fortunes. And ſo I was forced to leave poor <hi>Periander,</hi> before he was come to himſelf, although I feared that as my preſence had ſtrucken him, ſo my departure would kill him. Nevertheleſſe, ſéeing
<pb facs="tcp:165993:61"/> there was no remedy, I took it as patiently as I could, and away I went, though I was not permitted to go far; for the Maids of the houſe ſo flung about me, and kept ſuch adoe with me to know the ſequel of their fortunes, and to have me fully reſolve them in all points which they deſired to know, (ſéeing I was ſo haſtily called from them by <hi>Florina,</hi> that I had not half ſatisfied them before) that I could ſcarce get from them. And my luck was ſuch, that while I was buſie with anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to their queſtions, the Gaolor had heard that <hi>Florina</hi> was miſſed in the Court, and looked for, to come to the Queen her mother, which when he had ſignified unto her, ſhe ſtayed not, but incontinently hied to the Court. <hi>Periander</hi> therefore by this time being reſtored to his wits, and ſéeing both time and place ſerve to talk with me in ſecret, to the end that I ſhould not be diſcried, willed the Gaolor to bid me to come unto him, for that he earneſtly deſired to confer with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nature of certain hearbs that grow in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peculiar matters. To be ſhort, the Gaolor ſent me in to <hi>Periander,</hi> and there left me with him alone, where he came and embraced me, his eyes diſtilling and guſhing forth whole ſtreames of teares, ſaying, <hi>Briſil, Briſil,</hi> pardon mee, that you were not by mee welcommed and entertained at your arrivall, according to your deſerts, and my duty. For where neceſſity nippeth, all muſt obey. And doubt not that <hi>Leander</hi> had béene more welcome to loving <hi>Ero,</hi> if the ſwelling waves had not hindred his journey by glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves with his carkaſſe, and ſo ſtayed him from the wiſhed Tower, unto which he was ſwimming, then thou moſt worthy <hi>Briſil</hi> to thy faithfull <hi>Periander.</hi> It were too long for me (worthy Shepheards) to declare what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cheriſhments and loving congratulations that hee made. To be ſhort, we talked of many matters (as you may well think,) of Sir <hi>Maſſicourts</hi> Conſpiration and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon eſpecially, which was the firſt ſtep to all our troubles; of the Quéenes death; of the Kings unnaturall tyranny, of my ſecret flight of our Fortune on the Sea, of my Maſter:
<pb facs="tcp:165993:61"/> to be ſhort, there was nothing raked up in ſilence, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned our fortune. At length, the chiefeſt matter and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of all our conference was offered, when as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving informed each other of all our adventures ſince that time that we were by the policy of traiterous <hi>Maſſicourt</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated entred into conſultation what we might do to ſhun the eminent danger which was like to fall upon us, by reaſon of the Kings wrathfulneſſe. And after we had long deliberated, now intending to uſe this means, now that at length, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to take the vantage of the time, ſéeing that by means of <hi>Florina. Periander</hi> was not kept ſo ſtraightly, but that he might go ſecretly out of the priſon, and walk whither he would to take the air. Therefore leaſt if his father the King of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhould upon my flight ſend new Embaſſadors to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to have his ſon put to death (for he divers times ſwore unto me that <hi>Periander</hi> ſhould die if he any way hindered his marriage with me,) or brought <hi>Albion</hi> to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all not according to fatherly affection, but his mercileſſe rage, we thought beſt not to expect the worſt, but to play ſafe as long as time and occaſion was offered us. To make few words <hi>Periander</hi> the next morning by break of day got out of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (telling the Iaylor that he went to a place where <hi>Florina</hi> had appointed him to méet her) and coming to the houſ where I waited for him, ſhe preſently departed from <hi>Sivil,</hi> intending to trabel towards ſome ſolitary place, where we might live untill we heard of the death of the King of <hi>Albion.</hi> And becauſe we ſhould not be known, if ſearch were made after us, we cloathed our ſelves both alike in the habite of country maids, as if we had been two ſiſters.</p>

               <p>Inſomuch that poor <hi>Petulca</hi> (for ſo was that wretched ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard called) ſo miſerably loved, that all the Countrey knew by his colour, what Captain he honoured and ſerved. His joy and welfare which was wont to recreate the whole company of the Inhabitants, was changed into Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
               <p>His young face which was a faſhion of Modeſty, Grace, Mirth, Beauty and Comlineſs, waxed wrinkled, his limbes weakened, and all his body decayed: So that as he was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally pittied of all men, ſo were we moſt wofully grieved at his hard Fortune, though wée could not help or remedy the ſame.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, ſéeing that <hi>Petulca</hi> ceaſed not from his ſuit, but ſo hotly followed his cauſe, pleading for mercy to ſave his life, I counſelled <hi>Periander</hi> to fain as if he loved him, hoping that we might by that deviſe and meane eſcape the ill will and anger which we were like to gain of all our Neighbours if the youth had died. For his paſſion was ſuch that nothing but death only could move him to leave his love. Thus <hi>Petulca</hi> loving a young Prince in the habit of a lovely ſhepheard, and perceiving that he had won the Fort which he had ſo fiercly aſſaulted, revived again, and in ſhort time became as pert &amp; as trim as ever he had been. He came twice or thrice in the week unto us, and ſo pleaſantly diſcourſed of divers matters as occaſion offered, that we could not have changed the recreation which he had by his honeſt company and merry converſation, for the richeſt jewell of <hi>India.</hi> As he had lived in this contented and pleaſant manner one month, it happened that the daughter of a ſhepheard called <hi>Petrueco,</hi> dwelling in the next Farm to our cotage, was fo intricated in the net of affection, and ſo intangled in the beauty of <hi>Petulca,</hi> that ſhe allured him by continuall favours, loving glaunces, curteous gréetings, pleaſant ſpéeches, and all means ſhe could invent to gain his good will, and to move him to love her; but all the world was not able to alter his minde, though we wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that he might have béen inticed by her deſerts, to repent

                  <hi>Petulca</hi> was ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he would not any way requite her curteſies with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſhe began moſt deadly to hate my ſiſter (I mean <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) ſuppoſing her to be the cauſe of all her wo: For as ſhe knew <hi>Petulca</hi> was in love of my ſaid ſiſter, ſo ſhe thought that he was as well liked of her; which induced her to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we of purpoſe entertaind him the more kindly to hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der her matter: whereas contrarily when we knew that ſhe ſo dearly affectioned him we made leſs account of him, hoping that he wearied with our coyneſſe, might have lent his eare to his new Miſtreſſe that honoured him ſo highly.

So that to be ſhort, <hi>Bergama</hi> (for that was this other Shepheards name) promiſed her neece that what ſhe could do, ſhe would be ready to performe. Whereupon ſhe told her what ſhe would have her to do, inſtructing her in all points concerning the

Which tended to no other end then to work our woe, and by expelling us by their treachery out of thoſe quarters, to enjoy the love of <hi>Petulca.</hi> Inſomuch that theſe two Neeces having agreed and concluded upon the premiſes, thus began <hi>Bergama</hi> to play her part. But you muſt note, that when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulca</hi> the amorons ſhepheard uſed to come to our field, his way lay hy the place where <hi>Bergama</hi> kept her ſheep. So that ſhe eſpying him, on a certain morning betimes marching over her ground to come to paſs the time with us in merry chat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his maner, ſhe ſtepped unto him, and knowing with what kind of talk ſhe might ſtay his journey, ſhe cunningly held him prattle until ſuch time as ſhe eſpied that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.

With that ſhe did lead us both into a delectable Arbor, whence I might ſée my ſheep as well as if I had been in mine owne field, and therefore was the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intreated to ſtay with her. In the midſt of this Arbour was a table of Marble ſtone, on which ſhe laid a fair napkin, and ſet before us ſuch chear as was moſt wiſhed for in the Countrey at that time of the year, praying us to ſit downe and take ſuch fare as ſhe had in good part, ſith ſhe envited us not for the excellency of her delicates, but for good will and pleaſure of our company. So ſhe placed the ſhepheard <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulca</hi> and me together on one ſide of the Table, and ſhe her ſelf ſate on the other.

                  <hi>Periander</hi> giving faith to this <hi>Syrens</hi> ſweet Song, went with her, and according to her ſaying, ſaw us together, though we poor ſouls moſt innocent, and thought of no ſuch ſuppoſed villany. Yet Fortune to marre our matter the more, and to give the greater colour to <hi>Malorena's</hi> tale, would have it ſo, that while <hi>Periander</hi> ſtood with that traitreſs and looked upon us, the ſhepheard <hi>Petulca</hi> being of cuſtom merry and pleaſant, ſmacked his lips on my cheek as I ſat by him, which I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his humour, that he did it of wantonneſs, and not of love, made not ſtrange of it, &amp; ſeemed not to take it in ill part, ſith the ſhepheard meant no evil by it: But alas!

                  <pb facs="tcp:165993:65"/> and to curſe Fortune yet at this hour. For when <hi>Periander</hi> had ſéen us in the Arbor, he returned home preſently, and thanking <hi>Malorena,</hi> that ſhe had ſo faithfully bewrayed our treachery unto him, deſired her to return home with him, where he wrote a Letter unto me, and ſealing it up gave it to <hi>Malorena,</hi> and not doubting of her fidelity, prayed her to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it unto me; which he promiſed to do, and departed from <hi>Periander,</hi> who incontinently went his way <hi>I</hi> know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſince that time that he went home and I was called by <hi>Bergama,</hi> I never ſaw him, nor heard of him, nor could know what is become of him. The traitreſs ſéeing how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſhe had deluded her neighbour, unripped the ſeales of the Letter, thinking ſhe might be her ſecretary ſéeing ſhe had done her ſo good a turn; but by chance looking on the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before ſhe had read the contents, and ſeeing <hi>Periander</hi> written inſtead of <hi>Sybilla,</hi> was ſtrucken in a maze on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not knowing what it meant, but to be the better enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhe read the Letter which was thus penned.</p>

Inſomuch (quoth <hi>Maffeo</hi>) that when I heard <hi>Marcelio</hi> (whom I til that time never had ſeen) ſo pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully breath forth his plaints to the mercileſs skies, I thought my ſelf favoured of the Gods, that I was not onely tormented with the ſting of adverſity, ſeeing there were more that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed their adventures then my ſelf. And in truth I ſo pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied <hi>Marcelio</hi> his caſe, that I aſſwaged mine own grief by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him; when I found him ſo deſolate, and void of all conſolation and hope. So that he glad of my company and I of his, after we had declared our troubles each to other, we purpoſed to travel together, and ſo have kept one the other company theſe five days. In which time we have courſed over moſt part of all the villages aout the river <hi>Ezla,</hi> where old <hi>Camillo</hi> your father dwelleth. And as we were one evening ſomething late in a pleaſant grove, ſome 40 leagues from this place, we (overcome by the weariſomneſſe of our journey, and heavineſſe of our ſorrows) fel aſléep. Where being awaked by three moſt beautifull nymphs, of them received a letter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto us both: whereof we greatly marvelled, ſéeing that no man in the world knew of our amity and friendſhip, which was out of two or three days continuance. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we hoped more then we feared. For we thought that ſuch divine things could not happen but for our better luck &amp; content.

In the mean time if occaſion were offered that our ſervice might requite your courteſie, till death we acknowledge our ſelves bound both unto you and the ſoveraign Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:165993:68"/> who hath ſent you hither to direct our ſtraying paces, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe us in ſome ſtayed path, by following of which we may obtain the end of our hapleſſe journey.</p>
               <p>Curteous knight (replied one of the Nymphs) recompence we neither deſerve nor deſire, our meſſage we bring and thus deliver it. Séeing you have read the Letter, it may pleaſe you to ſtay here till you ſée us no longer but ſo, that you mark well what way we take, and then follow us at your pleaſure, and you ſhall not miſſe of the way which our Lady doth write of. And therewith the Nymphs moſt courteouſly taking their leaves departed from us, though we were ſorry to ſée them goe, and leave us behinde them. Yet we encouraged by their words, followed, being led by the guide of hope, not ſo much knowing whether we goe right, as hoping that wée are in in the way which the Lady promiſed that wée ſhould take.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>(Perierio,)</hi> you have heard what ſucceſſe we have had ſince I was with you.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Perierio, Iſmenia,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> had heard the words of <hi>Maffeo,</hi> marvelled at the ſtrangeneſſe thereof, and told him, that unleſſe they were deceived, they were in their direct way to the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> whither they alſo travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſame <hi>Felicia,</hi> to crave her ayde and counſaile for the abridgement of their ſorrowes. <hi>Maffeo</hi> paſſing glad of that, waked <hi>Marcelio,</hi> who in like manner as his fellow had done, knew and ſaluted <hi>Perierio.</hi> And after they had very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly greeted one another, and each diſcharged him of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to the rules of civility, they marchd on purſuing their journey.

Which to beguile the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome journey, and to pleaſure the Knights, they did all thrée performe.</p>
               <p>When they had ended each his diſcourſe, they came néere
<pb facs="tcp:165993:68"/> to a moſt pleaſant Grove, beautified with ſundry ranks of tall trées, which yielded ſuch a pleaſant ſhadow, that they could not paſs by that place without entring into it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſuch pleaſure as the amerity thereof did offer them. This Grove was ſo perfectly made by Natures skill, and hedged with ſuch pleaſant buſhes, that the manner thereof farre exceeded the artificial Gardening invented by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of mortal men.</p>
               <p>As theſe Lovers walked up and down the Grove, when they came neer the hedge, they ſate downe, and liſtning, they heard certain ſhepheards ſinging to the ſound of their Oaten Pipes.

                  <hi>Marcelio</hi> who was with the other Lovers on the otherſide of the hedge, hearing very attentively what talk the Knight &amp; the Lady had, was ſo aſtoniſhed to hear them name him that he ſcarce beléeved that he was the man they named; but began to imagin that it was ſome other <hi>Marcelio</hi> and <hi>Alcida</hi> they ſpake of. But to be reſolved, he climbed on a trée, and looking over the hedge, eſpied that it was <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> brother and ſiſter to his <hi>Alcida;</hi> whereof he was ſo glad, that he ran unto them and imbraced them both with tears expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his exceeding joy, ſéeing he could not utter one word in a long while he was ſo ſuddenly ſurprized with gladneſs. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> marvelled greatly what this might mean; for becauſe <hi>Marcelio</hi> was apparelled like a Shepheard, they knew him not, till ſuch time that his ſobs and tears permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to utter theſe ſpéeches. Ah brother of my heart, now do I not care for my misfortune, ſéeing that I am ſo happy as to ſee thee. But what, is not <hi>Alcida</hi> by thee? Or doth ſhe perhaps hide her ſelf in ſome ſecret place of the Grove? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to let me know ſome newes of her, if thou knoweſt any, &amp; deliver me from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> torment which I ſuffer. Herewith <hi>Polydor</hi> &amp; his ſiſter knew <hi>Marcelio,</hi> and imbracing him ſaid.</p>
               <p>O moſt bleſſed day! O moſt happy hour! Ah brother to our ſoul, what cruel diſaſter hath been cauſe that thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the company of <hi>Alcida,</hi> and us of her preſence? Why doſt thou march thus diſguiſed? Why doſt thou wear ſuch counterfeit apparel? Ah cruel Fortune! It is moſt certain that there is no perfect content in any thing whatſoever.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Maffeo,</hi> with the other Lovers, ſeeing that <hi>Marcelio</hi> had ſo luckily met with <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> were very glad, and ſo they marched altogether toward the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> And by that time that they had gone two leagues, the Sun being at the higheſt, forced them to take the ſhadow of certain trees that grew about a pleaſant Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Where they all ſat down, and waſhing their hands in the Chriſtaline water that iſſued out of the Fountain, each one ſetting out ſuch proviſion as they had brought with them,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:71"/> they refreſhed themſelves, and having ſatified their hunger, after that <hi>Marcelio</hi> had told <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune he had after his departure from them, he deſired <hi>Polydor</hi> to let him know what adventures he had had, ſince that time that he left him with old <hi>Eugerio</hi> in the Ship, when he with <hi>Alcida</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> leaped in the ſhip-boat, and ſo were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their ſight by the tempeſtuous waves; thinking ſure that they had miſerably periſhed with that unfortunate ſhip. Whereupon <hi>Polydor</hi> began thus to rehearſe how he and his father eſcaped the danger of the Sea, uſing as much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as he poſſibly could, becauſe he thought it would be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the reſt of the company, to hear matters that were full of ſorrow recited.</p>
               <p>After that I was hindred by the Pilot and the Mariner (quoth <hi>Polydor</hi>) when I had prepared my ſelf to leap into the ſhip-boat with my father, ſo that we were compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that unfortunate and dangerous ſhip; our aged father was ſo diſtreſſed, as we may ſuppoſe that a loving father may be, who in the latter end of his old age, ſéeth both his own life and his dear childrens alſo, in ſuch preſent danger. He did not greatly complain of the waves that battered the flanks of the ſhip, neither did he regard the boiſterous winds that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet our Veſſel of all ſides; but when he beheld the boat in which you were with <hi>Alcida</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> (which ſéemed at every moment to be overwhelmed and drowned in the riſing waves which ſéemed to flée over the boat) he thought that his heart was pulled out of his belly; and when you were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us that we could not ſee you any more, he was ſo grieved, that I feared leſt he ſhould have preſently died.</p>
               <p>The ſhip being led by Fortunes will went aſtray up and down the ſea for the ſpace of five dayes, after we had loſt the ſight of the boat, at the end of which ſpace, <hi>Phoebus</hi> being néer his Weſtern home, we found our ſelvs to be in ſight of land. Whereof the Mariners rejoyced marvellouſly, as much for that they had recovered the hope which they had altogether loſt and given over, as for that they knew in what coaſt they
<pb facs="tcp:165993:71"/> were arrived; for the land which they ſaw was the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Countrey and the moſt delectableſt place that the Sun penetrated with his beams, abounding with all kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure. Inſomuch that one of the Mariners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus to cry out, O bleſſed and happy land of <hi>Valentia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe, which the Sea being irrited and provoked to ice, doth vex and afflict. Happy are they that being out of danger to be ſwallowed up by the greedy waves, enjoy thy fertility, and the méekneſs of they aire! With far more labour doth the Ship eare the Sea, then the labourer doth thy fields. O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable land, before the ſea become more enraged againſt us, receive us into thy pleaſant boſome, ſéeing we are almoſt ſpoiled and forlorn, and thou ſhalt do as much for us as hée that ſaveth anothers life. Receive us I ſay, O beautifull Countrey of <hi>Valentia,</hi> that we having once ſet foot on land, never return to ſea again.</p>
               <p>By theſe words of the Mariner, we gathered that we were néer <hi>Valentia,</hi> which countrey is famous through all the world. But while the Mariner thus called to the mercileſs land, the Ship bring driven with a furious wind, arrived ſo néer the land, that if we had not wanted the boat, we might have reached unto it. Nevertheleſs, certain fiſhermen fiſhing not far from us, and ſeeing our Maſt rent our Anchor loſt, our ſailes torn, and our ſhip pittifully buttered, perceived in what extremity we were. Therefore with all ſpeed they came to ſuccour us, and with much trouble they fetched us out of the Ship and led us to Land. The joy which we conceived thereof, was ſuch as every man may and ought to imagine. <hi>Eugerio</hi> and I, we thanked the Fiſhers for their help, in that our great neceſſity, according to our duty. But they as men of a good and ſimple heart, by nature pitttifull, regarded not our thanks, nor would take any reward at our hands for their paines, one of them making us this anſwer. Sirs, thank us not for this déed, for you ſhall know that we are bound to ſuccour and help all men that are in like neceſſity, and therefore take our readineſs and good will in good part which
<pb facs="tcp:165993:72"/> forceth us to do good unto all men, whoſe extremities want our aide. And perſwade your ſelves, that as often as ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall be offered as this, we will do the like, although we ſhould thereby hazard our lives, and intrude our ſelves into danger. For this morning happened ſuch a chance, that if we had not remedied the ſame as we now have done this, we had been grieved therewith all the dayes of our life. The chance was this. At the point of the day, we went out of our lodges with our nets, and our other ordinary preparations to fiſh withall; and before we came to the ſea ſide, we ſaw that the ayre was overcaſt with a dark myſt, and heard that the ſea raged by reaſon of the boyſterous winds which blew very ruthly, in ſo much that we were twice of opinion to return home again, fearing to commit our ſelves to the dangerous ſtreames, in ſuch a malicious and perilous time. But ſome of us thought good that we ſhould go to the ſhore, ſide to ſée whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tempeſt would ſlacken, and the weather change. For it happeneth ſomtimes, that after a great tempeſt the weather changeth on the ſudden, and ſpreadeth a calm over the whole ſea. But as we came to the ſea ſide, we eſpied a great boat ſo ſhaken with the wind, and bruiſed with the waves, without maſt, ſailes, oares, and all other ſeafaring inſtruments, that unleſs this had been néer the ſhore, they could not have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped preſent death: to be ſhort, they were in the very ſame caſe that you even now were. We moved to compaſſion, without regarding the peril unto which we ſubmitted our ſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leaped all into one of our Ships, and with all ſpéed rowed towards thoſe forlorn perſons. When we were ſo neer them, that we might ſee them that were in the boat, we eſpied a young Lady, whoſe face was covered with tears, and her cheeks ſo blubbered with the water that iſſued out of her eyes that it would have moved a Tyger to pitty. Which La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as ſoon as ſhe perceived us rowing towards her, expected our romming, with her armes ſtretched, and ſaid unto us. Ah brothers, I heſeech you to deliver mo from this imminent danger with which Fortune menaceth us preſently, and more
<pb facs="tcp:165993:72"/> earneſtly do I beſeech you to deliver me from the power of this Traytor which is by me, who againſt all reaſon and equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keepeth me priſoner, and moſt villanouſly offereth to force and violate my chaſtity. When we had underſtood that, with all ſpeed &amp; diligence that we could (and that not without great danger) we pulled them out of their boat, &amp; ſetting them aboord on our ſhip, we brought them to the ſhore, where ſhe told unto us al the vilany of the traitrous Mariner that was with her; how he had abuſed her and her ſiſter, with a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man allied unto her, which would be long to rehearſe. But we have exempted her from the villains and led her to our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where ſhe is yet with our wives and daughters out of all danger to fall in the hands of thoſe malicious and diſhoneſt caitiffs that were in the boat with her, whom we have caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon not far hence, where we will cauſe them ſhortly to be puniſhed and chaſtiſed according to their deſerts; ſeeing then that ſuch and event hapned, (as in like manner more may happen) who is there of us all that would not, nay that ought not willingly to hazard their lives in like danger, to recover the welfare of thoſe that are loſt, &amp; to do good unto thoſe that are abuſed and afflicted? When <hi>Eugerio</hi> my father heard the fiſher ſay ſo, he thought that the ſame yong Lady might have been one of his daughters, and although the fiſher could not tell us her name, we hoped nevertheleſs ſhortly to be reſolved of our doubt, by reaſon that the Lady was not far off, and that the Fiſher did lead us unto the houſe where ſhe was, that we might there take our reſt. As we came neer the houſe we heard the women ſing that were within; and we ſo longed to ſee the Lady, that we could ſcarce reach to the houſe in time enough to know what ſhe was; but entring into the lodging, the Fiſhers wife with her daughters and her maids, marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſee what new gueſts came thither, they all held their peace, and left their ſong; and among them did we ſee the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel whereof the Fiſher had ſpoken, whom we incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew, and were of her known, for it was my ſiſter <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> who is here preſent at this time, and may tell you how ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:73"/> fared after that ſhe was ſeparated from you, by means of the Traytor <hi>Bartophamus,</hi> and how ſhe came ſo luckily unto that ſelf-ſame place where both ſhe and we were ſaved, by the help of thoſe pitiful and curteous Fiſhers; but when we had heard of the treaſon of the ſame Villain <hi>Bartophamus,</hi> of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Alcida,</hi> and of your captivity, I leave it to your diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conſider how grieved we were, as <hi>Clenarde</hi> my ſiſter wel perceived, and may witneſs; for the joy of our arrival to land, and delivery out of that preſent danger, was turnd into mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, all our pleaſure into grief, and all our comfort into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Inſomuch that the fiſher ſéeing how pittifully we were grieved and afflicted, for the miſhap of <hi>Alcida</hi> and your ſelf, he comforted us as much as lay in him, and told us of a certain Lady called <hi>Felicia,</hi> bearing rule over the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe had ſuch infinite knowledge and wiſdom, that ſhe could remedy our evil by telling us what was become either of <hi>Alcida</hi> or your ſelf, whereof we were very glad; for that was the chiefeſt thing that we deſired to know. Wherefore we reſting there that night, as ſoon as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had ſaluted the Fiſhers cottage we roſe, and thanking the fiſher and his wife for their ineſtimable goodneſs and friendſhip towards us, and rewarding them according to our power, we departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning, leaving the Mariners there. To be ſhort we marched, <hi>Eugerio, Clenarde,</hi> and I, till we reached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> where we ſaw the Palace where the wiſe Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> holdeth her reſidence. We beheld the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent building both of the place and of the temple, we ſaw the moſt pleaſant Gardens, the ſumptuous towers, the moſt wiſe and diſcreet Lady, and many other things that have ſo ſuſpended our minds with admiration and marvel, that I am not able to make rehearſal according thereof. We ſaw in like manner the moſt excelent and beautiful Nymphs that attend on the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> and many other ſhepheards both men and maids and divers Knights, Gentlemen, Ladies, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, that were come thither to have their harmes reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by the ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> who had given them great comfort
<pb facs="tcp:165993:73"/> in their love and neceſſity, But as concerning us, the aid and help which ſhe hath done us untill this preſent, is, that ſhe hath kept our father <hi>Eugerio</hi> by her, willing us to go unto theſe quarters, and not return untill we had occaſion to be better contented. And forasmuch as we have received no ſmal contentment and joy of your life and preſence, we think we have ſufficient occaſion offered us to return to the ſage <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> eſpecially ſéeing we have in her company left our aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all alone, and deſolate, among ſtrangers, I know that it importeth greatly for his comfort, that we ſhould find out our ſiſter <hi>Alcida;</hi> But ſéeing that fortune in ſo long time hath bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us from underſtanding where ſhe is, or hearing any thing of her, I think it convenient that we deprive not our father any longer of our company and preſence.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Polidor</hi> had ended his diſcourſe, all the company mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling at the ſtrangeneſſe of his and <hi>Clenardes</hi> adventures, comforted <hi>Marcelio,</hi> who wept bitterly for <hi>Alcidaes</hi> ſake: and as ſoon as his tears would permit him, he recounted unto <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidor</hi> and <hi>clenarde,</hi> what had hapned unto him ſince he ſaw them laſt. But <hi>Iſmenia</hi> with the Lady <hi>Briſil, Perierio</hi> and <hi>Maf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feo,</hi> having heard the report that <hi>Polidor</hi> made of the ſage La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Felicia,</hi> were pricked with a greedy deſire to arrive to the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tly becauſe they wiſhed to ſée that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lady, and partly for that they gathered by the praiſe which <hi>Polidor</hi> gave her, for her diſcretion &amp; wiſdom, that they ſhould have occaſion to hope for the redreſs &amp; remedy of their harms For they were in great hope that ſome of them whom they ſo diligently &amp; painfully ſought for either were already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe gentlemen, damoſels, &amp; ſhepheards which <hi>Polydor</hi> ſaid that he had ſéen with the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> or ſhould be ere long by means of the ſaid Ladies ſingular wiſdom and experience.</p>
               <p>The Sun by this time began to fall in the Weſtern plains, and thereby was not ſo hot but that <hi>Polydor</hi> thought good to march forward, that they might in good time reach to the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Lady <hi>Felicia.</hi> Which liking all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, they roſe all and went on their journey. They had not gone paſſing a
<pb facs="tcp:165993:74"/> league and a half, but they met a certain nymph, whom the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> foreknowing the comming of this worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, had ſent to let them know of certain things which ſhe would have them acquainted with before they came unto her, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all things might ſuccéed according as ſhe through her incredible wiſdome thought convenient. <hi>Marcelio</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the reſt of his company coming to the place where the nymph was, ſaluted her very curteouſly as ſhe likewiſe did him and all the other that were by him, and asked them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were going: whereunto they anſwered, that they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t toward the temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> She hearing that ſaid; for as much as I can gather by the valor and worthineſſe of your perſons, I believe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> of whoſe nimphs I am one, will be very glad of your company. And ſéeing that <hi>Phoebus</hi> doth now begin to prepare for his evening lodging, &amp; the day draweth to an end, I wil return home with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ye ſhall be received with great triumph. They thanked her greatly, that ſhe would keep them company and went on with her towards the temple. For they conceived marvellous hope by her words, and although <hi>Polydor</hi> &amp; <hi>Clenarde</hi> had been in the Pallace before, yet they remembred not that they had ſéen her among the other nymphs, by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude of the nymphs of the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> who all of them obeying the commandement of their ſage Lady, are imployed in ſundry charges and divers places. So that <hi>Polydor</hi> asked this nimph how ſhe was called, whereupon ſhe anſwered her name was <hi>Arethea. Clenarde</hi> demanded what news was in the Ladies Pallace? ſhe anſwered, that the chiefeſt news ſhe knew was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two hours before her departure from thence, there arrived a young Lady in the habit of a ſhepheardeſſe, who being eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an aged Knight that was at that preſent with the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> was known to be his daughter: and that becauſe ſhe had a long time gone aſtray through moſt parts of the world, the aged Knight her father was ſo joyfull of her arrival, that the rumor of that young Ladies fortune, was ſpread through al the villages about the temple of <hi>Diana. Marcelio</hi> liſtening at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
<pb facs="tcp:165993:74"/> to theſe words, greedily deſiring to know whether the Lady ſhe ſpake of were <hi>Alcida,</hi> could not but interrupt the nymph as ſhe went to go forward in the relation of her news, and ſo he asked her how the aged Knight was called. Vnleſſe my memory fail me, anſwered the nymph, he is called <hi>Eugerio,</hi> and his daughter <hi>Alcida.</hi> Wherewith <hi>Marcelio</hi> ſurprized with excéeding joy, after he had a long time ſtood as if he had been in a trance, at length burſt out into theſe words. Ah moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed troubles that take end by ſo proſperous an adventure! ah fortune and as he meant to have gone forward, he could not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one word more, but fell down on the ground wholly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The Lady <hi>Briſil, Iſmenia,</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> flocked about him to incourage him, and did ſo much prevail, that he came to himſelf again. In the mean time, <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde,</hi> were marvellous joyfull at that news, ſéeing that all their miſfortunes ſhould take end by the comming of their ſiſter <hi>Alcida, Maffeo, Perierio,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> with <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> were likewiſe glad for <hi>Marcelio's</hi> ſake, and hoped likewiſe that as the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> had wrought his bliſſe, ſo ſhe would likewiſe being moved with compaſſion of their miſeries, redreſſe their grief. <hi>Iſmenia</hi> deſirous to hear ſomething of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Lexander,</hi> ſaid to <hi>Arethee,</hi> fair Nymgh, I was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly well contented, and received great joy to hear of the general gladneſſe that is in the Ladies Pallace, by reaſon of the arrivall of the Lady <hi>Alcida:</hi> but yet I ſhould conceive more perfect pleaſure, if it would pleaſe you to tell me what ſhepheard of account there is at this preſent in the Pallace. <hi>Arethee</hi> anſwered, you ſhall find divers ſhepheards of account whoſe names I remember not, yet two or three I know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt. There is one ſhepheard called <hi>Petulca</hi> of whom the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> maketh great account of, for his wit and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. Beſides there is a ſhepheard called <hi>Philorenus,</hi> whoſe preſence pleaſeth the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> as much. The Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> hearing <hi>Petulca</hi> named, marvelled to know how he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to what end; and therefore asked the nymph, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iſmenia</hi> although ſhe heard not that her beloved <hi>Lexander</hi> was among the other ſhepheards which <hi>Arethee</hi> had named yet for that ſhe heard that the Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> had heard ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her matters, ſhe took the more heart in her own cauſe, and was glad for the poor diſtreſſed Dutcheſſe ſake, hoping that ſhe ſhould receive comfort of the Lady <hi>Felicia.</hi>

They thanked her moſt humbly, and finally took their leave of her, but ſhe cauſed <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> to ſtay with her, ſaying ſhe had ſomething to ſay unto them: but the others were led by <hi>Arethee</hi> to a ſide place of the Pallace, where they were feaſted that night, and provided of all things
<pb facs="tcp:165993:76"/> neceſſary for their cheriſhment and reſt. This houſe was ſo ſumptuous and magnificent, garniſhed with ſuch rich move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and beautified with ſuch delightfull gardens orch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Supper was prepared for them moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently, and it was ſerved up unto them in veſſels of Gold and Chriſtal. And when the night was approached, and bed time at hand, they were laid on ſuch good and eaſie beds, that howbeit their bodies were wearied by travel, yet the ſoftneſſe of the delicate down, with the hope which <hi>Felicia</hi> had given them, provoked them to a moſt pleaſant and ſwéet ſléep.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> with <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde,</hi> (whom ſhe willed to make no mention of the arrival of <hi>Marcelio</hi> and the reſt of his company) went into one of her moſt pleaſant gardens, where <hi>Eugerio</hi> walked alone, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Alcida</hi> onely being by him who although ſhe yet had on the ſame ſhepheardlike apparel that ſhe did wear at her firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there, nevertheleſſe was incontinently known of her brother and ſiſter <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde.</hi>

               <p>Moſt noble and beautifull <hi>Alcica,</hi> notwithſtanding that Fortune hath beene ſo great an enemy unto you in afflicting you with ſo many troubles and vexations, yet cannot you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that by reaſon of the great content which you now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, you are fully revenged of the injury which ſhe hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done you. And for as much as the errour which you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, until this preſent day, without cauſe abhorring your <hi>Marcelio</hi> is ſufficient (if you yet hold the ſame opinion) to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your heart, and to breed his excéeding miſery; it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I ſhould declare unto you, how that you are terriblie deceived if you be of that opinion. For the preſumption which you have of <hi>Marcelio,</hi> is quite contrary and otherwiſe then you mean; for when you were left alone in the Iſle, that came not by his fault, but by the villany of a certain traitor ſubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Fortune to aggravate your miſhap, who to recompence the wrong which ſhe hath offered you, hath directed your ſteps hither towards me, in whoſe mouth you ſhall not find any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then truth. Your ſiſter <hi>Clenarde</hi> ſhall largely tell you all that concerneth this matter, and how it wholly ſtandeth, mark well what ſhe ſhall ſay unto you and give credit to her words; for as for me, I ſwear unto you, that whatſoever ſhe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe concerning this, ſhall be moſt certain and veritable.</p>
               <p>Whereupon preſently <hi>Clenarde</hi> began to inform <hi>Alcida</hi> how all things had chanced, excuſing <hi>Marcelio</hi> and her ſelfe, and largely declared the treaſon of <hi>Bartophamus,</hi> and all that which already hath been ſaid touching the ſame. <hi>Alcida</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very attentively given ear to her ſiſters ſpéech, was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully well contented to know the verity and truth of the caſe; and as ſhe did drive away and exclude her former rancor and falſe opinion from her heart, ſo did ſhe in like manner
<pb facs="tcp:165993:77"/> manner expel all ſuch anger and hate, which ſhe had underſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly conceived againſt <hi>Marcelio.</hi> Wherefore ſhe now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the errour, and perceiving that ſhe wrongfully had given over the love which in times paſt ſhe had born to <hi>Marcelio,</hi> the ſparkles of love that had ſo long béen raked up in the aſhes of oblivion, began to ſhew their force in her, and the affection which had ſlept thus long, began now to waken: inſomuch that ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Felicia,</hi> Madam, I acknowledge my fault, and the ſingular pleaſure which you have done me in bringing me into the knowledge thereof, But being at this preſent time delivered from that falſe opinion, and as well affectioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Marcelio</hi> as ever I was; who for that he is now ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if I may not injoy his company, I ſhall not obtain the perfect joy which I hoped to receive by your means, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I conceive another grief ſo exceſſive and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I ſhall be compelled to ſue for new favours at your graces hands, to remedy the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is a manifeſt token of love (anſwered the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi>) to fear the abſence, but as for that you ſhall have no cauſe to care. The Sun hath now drawen in his beams, it is time for you to retire, and to go to your chambers to take your reſt with your father and your ſiſter; to morrow morning will we talk of the reſt. Therewith ſhe went forth of the garden, and ſo did <hi>Eugerio</hi> with his daughters, and went to the place which <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> had appointed for them: which was ſeparated from that part where <hi>Marcelio</hi> with his company was lodged.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Phoebus</hi> had harneſſed his Steeds to run his wonted courſe, <hi>Eugerio, Polidor, Alcida, Clenarde,</hi> and other Gentlemen and ſhepheards that were in the Pallace at that time, met together in the garden, where ſitting by a fountain before the chambers where the Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> was lodged with <hi>Iſmenia, Perierio, Marcelio,</hi> and <hi>Maffeo,</hi> began one to play on the Lute, another on the Citharen, another on the Bandora, others on their Flutes, and ſome ſung prick ſongs; inſomuch that with their muſick they awaked the Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> and ſhe knocked up <hi>Perierio,</hi> and the other Knights
<pb facs="tcp:165993:77"/> that lay in the chambers above her. Who all of them lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their windowes, although they might not ſée all thoſe that ſate at the Fountain, by reaſon of certain Lawrell trées that grew about it, yet becauſe it was ſo neer to their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they could hear what they ſaid. They therefore liſtned very attentively each of them, <hi>Maffeo</hi> whether he might hear the voice of <hi>Eleonora,</hi> (for he hoped greatly that as the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> had written unto him as well as unto <hi>Marcelio,</hi> that therefore in like manner, <hi>Eleonora</hi> ſhould have béen arrived at the Palace as well as <hi>Alcida;</hi> notwithſtanding that the Nymph <hi>Arethee</hi> had not made any mention of her) and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celio,</hi> whether he might heare his <hi>Alcida.</hi> As for <hi>Perierio</hi> he could not hope to ſée the Lady whom he loved, and therefore was more ſad then the reſt, and looked out at the window more to fortget the fantaſies by the pleaſant Muſick of thoſe that were in the Garden, and to paſs the time in beholding the beauty of divers Ladies and ſhepheards which were there. The Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> harkned whether <hi>Petulca</hi> the ſhepheard ſung, to know whether he had heard any thing of <hi>Periander.</hi> But <hi>Iſmenia</hi> being ſorely diſcomforted becauſe <hi>Arethee</hi> the Nymph had not named <hi>Lexander,</hi> when ſhe asked what Shepheards were in the Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſhe was ſoon delivered from that ſuſpition, for after he had ended his Sonnet, he burſt out into theſe words with a moſt pittiful ſigh.</p>
               <p>Ah poore ſoule! what an high offence haſt thou committed, to beléeve ſuch falſe accuſations againſt thy ſwéet <hi>Iſmenia</hi> who honoureth thée above all wights in the world, whereas thou leaſt doſt deſerve it at her hands? And therefore doeſt thou worthily ſuffer the torment which thy lightneſſe and credulity hath procured thee. Ah my dear <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> how much better had it béen that thou hadſt not taken the paines to courſe the world like a forlorn wight to ſeek after thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Lexander,</hi> that he now acknowledging his fault, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to his houſe, and there find thee. Ah traitreſs <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veria,</hi> and was this the beſt reward thou couldſt afford me for the great pleaſure and ſervice I have done thee ſithence thy childhood? Yet I could account it a benefit that thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me of thy horrible treaſon, if thou hadſt come in time, for ſéeing thou haſt ſtayed ſo long, thy advertiſement hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:165993:78"/> to no end but to increaſe my grief, and multiply my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iſmenia</hi> had heard that, ſhe thought it time to thank the Gods for her fortune, and to give over all care and grief, <hi>Marcelio, Maffeo, Perierio,</hi> and Duches <hi>Briſil,</hi> were glad for her ſake, and ſéeing that ſo by little and little, their company was comforted, they were ſo encouraged, that they doubted not but that they ſhould all obtain their wiſhed deſires in time, judging that the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> was the onely Patroneſs that could redreſſe the ſorrowes of all ſuch true amourts as were afflicted by reaſon of their ſincere love.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Iſmenia</hi> was ſo tickled with deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the wiſhed company of her <hi>Lexander,</hi> that ſhe had almoſt throwne her ſelf out of the window, and ſo fallen down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Garden where he was: but ſéeing that her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hindred her from that unhappy meeting, ſhe would have preſently gone to the Garden, had not <hi>Marcelio</hi> and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Briſil</hi> exhorted her to ſtay till ſhe knew the Lady <hi>Felicia's</hi> pleaſure, who ſeeing the day appeared, and the Sun began to glance through her windowes, ſent <hi>Arethee</hi> the Nymph unto <hi>Marcelio</hi> and the reſt of his company: Therefore as <hi>Iſmenia</hi> was talking with <hi>Marcelio,</hi> of the great deſire ſhe had to be with <hi>Lexander, Arethee</hi> entring into the chamber where they were, and with a moſt courteous countenance ſaid unto them: Noble Gentlemen and fair Shepheards, I beſeech God to ſend you ſo good hap and fortune as you deſerve. The ſage La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Felicia</hi> hath ſent me hither, to know of you whether you have reſted better this night then the nights before, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye have received more content then of cuſtome you are wont to do. Beſides alſo hath ſhe commanded me to lead you into the Garden, whither ſhe will preſently come to ſpeak with you. But you <hi>Marcelio,</hi> muſt put on this ſute, which the Lady hath ſent you, and put off your Shepheards apparel, to the end that you may be cloathed according to your eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſmenia</hi> would not ſtay till <hi>Marcelio</hi> ſpake, but her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this anſwer unto the Nymph, for joy of the good news
<pb facs="tcp:165993:79"/> which ſhe brought. O bleſſed Nymph, what a good morning have you given us? How are we beholding unto you? God will recompence the pleaſure which you have done us, ſeeing that our ability ſufficeth not. As for the content which we have received this night it is greater then I can declare, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this morning we have been ſo happy as that I have recovered my life, and theſe other Gentlemen hope to obtain the ſame; wherefore to obey ſo worthy a Lady as ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> we are ready to go into the Garden with you to know her pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Arethee</hi> took from another Nymph that came with her, the coſtly and rich apparel which the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> had ſent <hi>Marcelio</hi> to put on, and helped him to cloath himſelf in that ſute which was wrought in pure gold &amp; precious pearls, moſt ſumptuous and bravely placed. As ſoon as he was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, they went forth of the chamber and followed <hi>Arethee</hi> into the Garden, where ſhe led them into an Arbor, whence they could not ſee thoſe that ſate at the Fountain, and taking the Lady <hi>Briſil</hi> and <hi>Perierio</hi> by the hand, left <hi>Marcelio, Maffeo,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> in the Arbor leading <hi>Perierio</hi> and the Duches to the Palace where ſhe left <hi>Perierio</hi> in a fair chamber under the bed-chamber of the <hi>Felicia,</hi> willing him there is expect the Ladies coming, and ſo mounting the Marble ſtaires, led the Duches up to <hi>Felicias</hi> chamber, where the Lady her ſelf run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the door, welcomed her in this ſort:</p>
               <p>Moſt gracious Princeſs, pardon me, for that I honoured you not yeſterday according to your merit and eſtate, for that I as yet knew not the worthineſs and excellency of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but this morning as I conſulted in the Temple of ſacred <hi>Diana</hi> our Soveraign Goddeſs, concerning your caſe and of your company, I was informed of the Nobility of your ſtock, of the antiquity of your houſe, of the perfections of your beauty and vertues of your minde and of your loyalty in the ſacred Lawes of ſincere Love and Chaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y. Know therefore moſt excellent Princeſs, that the Gods being moved with your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable vertue, have ſent you hither not only to enjoy the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:79"/> love of the beautifull and valorous young Prince <hi>Periander,</hi> but alſo to be hoyſed to the top of perpetual bliſſe and to live not thy ſelf onely, but all the Progeny that ſhall iſſue from thy fruitful worthy body, in ſuch honour as no time, no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, or nothing whatſoever ſhall be able to abate or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. In the mean time till the gods ſend us further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning this affair encourage your ſelf noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and give over all care and grief; let me take thought in your behalf, and I promiſe you that I will not ſleep upon the matter. But till occaſion be offered that it may be put in practiſe I ſhall deſire you to take patience to lodge in this my ſimple and ſolitary houſe, which though it be not comparable to the princely place of your bringing up, I mean the famous Court of <hi>Albion,</hi> yet I doubt not but for the recreation, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and content which you ſhall have in my company, you will think well of it, howſoever you find it farre inferiour to kingly Palaces, for the baſeneſs of the building. Moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lady, (anſwered the Duches) what thanks I may yield you for your high deſerts, I know not and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf that I wiſh you as much recompence as a mortal heart may conceive. As concerning my abode with you, I am ready to ſtay with you as long as you pleaſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I think ill of the place ſéeing that in magnificent building it ſurpaſſeth the ſtatelieſt Palace that I think may be in the world. But grant it were (as you ſay) inferiour to the mean Court of <hi>Albion,</hi> yet conſidering the excellency of your perſon, it may be judged the moſt pleaſant and delectable place under the vale of heaven. If you like ſo well of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany already (replied the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi>) I hope you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your liking when you have made trial of my readineſs to pleaſure you. But in the mean time, becauſe I muſt go unto the reſt of your company that is in your Garden, if it pleaſe you, put off your ſhepheards attire and apparel your ſelf with theſe Robes, which though they be as precious and coſtly as ever was any that entred in my wardrobe, yet are they not ſo ſumptuous as your vertues deſerve. And for that
<pb facs="tcp:165993:80"/> you have ſo chaſtly behaved your ſelf, and as yet kept your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity inviolated contrary to the opinion of all men whereas you have notwithſtanding ſo long kept ſecret company with your loving <hi>Periander,</hi> reſerving your Virginity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating the ſame to <hi>Diana,</hi> until ſuch time as your Marriage Rights being celebrated, you may by the laws of <hi>Hymaeneus,</hi> give an honourable adieu to virginity, and enjoy the fruits of your chaſt love; I give you this bunch of Roſes which ſhall not wither in winter or fade in the ſummer, but in token of your chaſtity reſerve their natural vigor and freſh colour as long as you live. As <hi>Felicio</hi> had ſo ſaid, whilſt her Nymphs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled the Duches, ſhe called <hi>Perierio</hi> by <hi>Arethee,</hi> &amp; ſaluting him very curteouſly told him that ſhe had not been leſs mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him then of the other of his company that night. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, quoth ſhe, put on the clothes that I wil ſend thee, and ſtay for my coming; as for all the reſt, diſburthen your ſelf of all care, and let me alone; and ſo ſhe departed from <hi>Perierio,</hi> who went to the chamber where <hi>Arethee</hi> had led him, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently eſpied <hi>Arethee</hi> coming with a fair ſute of black velvet as he was wont to wear before his father was exiled from <hi>Venice.

And you muſt note, that the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> had alſo cauſed <hi>Alcida</hi> that morning to leave off her ſhepheards coat, and apparel her ſelf in rich attire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her eſtate, that when ſhe ſhould meet with <hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> (who now was in like maner moſt ſumptuouſly appareled) ſhe ſhould not be disfigured with baſe clothes, though <hi>Alcida</hi> her ſelf as yet knew nothing of <hi>Marcelios</hi> being there. As then <hi>Eugerio</hi> and the reſt of thoſe that ſate at the Fountain, ſaw the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:80"/> Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> coming, being accompanied with ſo beautiful a Princeſs, marvelled greatly who the ſame young Lady ſhould be, and every one doing his obeyſance to the Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> and her company ſaluted her moſt humbly, as ſhe likewiſe with <hi>Briſil,</hi> and <hi>Perierio</hi> did them. The Duches ſéeing <hi>Alcida,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at her beauty, as likewiſe <hi>Alcida</hi> did at her; for by reaſon that ſhe was ſo ſumptuoſly and richly apparelled, her beauty which ſurpaſſed all Gentlewomen of her time, ſéemed rather to be heavenly then mortal. And though <hi>Polydor</hi> and <hi>Clenarde</hi> had ſéen her the day before, yea and gone two or thrée leagues in her company, yet the change of her attire ſo alter'd her, that they as yet knew not that ſhe was the Lady <hi>Briſil,</hi> whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was injured by that baſe ſhepheardlike attire. But <hi>Felicia</hi> calling <hi>Alcida</hi> and the ſhepheard <hi>Lexander</hi> unto her, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place where <hi>Marcelio</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> with <hi>Maffeo,</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her coming. They ſéeing her come, as they marvelled at the ſupernaturall beauty of the Duches, which had thus long been ſhadowed under a ruſtick habit, ſo were they excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding merry to ſee her ſo well accompanied to their joy and comfort; for <hi>Marcelio</hi> ſaw his <hi>Alcida</hi> of one ſide of her, and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> ſaw her <hi>Lexander</hi> on the other ſide. You may alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what a ſudden joy <hi>Alcida</hi> conceived to ſee her beloved <hi>Marcelio,</hi> and <hi>Lexander</hi> to ſee his dear <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> whoſe abſence he but one hour before ſo pittifully lamented.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Marcelio, Iſmenia,</hi> and <hi>Maffeo,</hi> had humbly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Felicia,</hi> and imbraced, <hi>Marcelio</hi> his <hi>Alcida,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> her <hi>Lexander,</hi> the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> left the Duches and <hi>Perierio</hi> there with them, and calling <hi>Maffeo</hi> unto her ſaid, Moſt valiant Knight though the gods have not as yet gladded you with the ſight of her whom you ſeek, in ſuch manner as the reſt of your company; yet let me intreat you to be of as good chear as theſe, ſeeing the joy which they have had, or is yet preſent is to come and future unto you.

               <p>There might you have ſéen the Lady welcome her gueſts with ſuch pleaſant countenance, that they tooke more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in beholding the ſame, then in taſting their meat; and the gueſts ſo courteouſly returned her thanks, generally over the whole boord, that ſhe had rather have miſſed her cates then her company; for ſhe took no ſmall delight to ſée ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed perſons by her meanes merrily drink one to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if they had never known of any ſorrow or grief; for the nature of that place is of ſuch force and efficacy, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into it, was combred with no care.</p>
               <p>Now neither did aged <hi>Eugerio</hi> remember the cruelty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Fortune danted him and his children on the Sea nor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida</hi> think of the Iſle of <hi>Formentera</hi> where ſhe was left alone, and in the Rock engraved her proteſtation, that ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after fancy man again, nor <hi>Clenarde</hi> mention the treaſons of <hi>Bartophanus</hi> againſt her and <hi>Marcelio.</hi> Now did <hi>Maffeo</hi> not dream that his <hi>Eleonora</hi> was taken from him while he ſléeped, nor that his couſin <hi>Sylveſtro</hi> deceived him of his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:84"/> you ſay you have had with our friend <hi>Petulca,</hi> as we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of, ſo doe we not envy at his luck in that ſo gracious a Princeſſe as your ſelf beareth a remembrance of him.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Petulca</hi> thought to ask pardon for his unmindfulnes, and to excuſe the weakneſs of his memory in that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he had in all his life time ſéen any Lady compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to her for her beauty or eſtate, much leſs to have ſeene her, the Duches ſtaied him ſaying, Well <hi>Petulca</hi> thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinketh thée happy that I beare memory of thée; but I pray you unhappy may I be thought to be, ſéeing that thou diſdaineſt to know her, whom I thought you would not have forgotten ſo ſoone. Is this the memory you have of me, and my ſiſter <hi>Sybil,</hi> whom you ſo dearly loved? Is this the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance you beare of curſed <hi>Malorena</hi> and diſſembling <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who for thy ſake ſought our ruine? <hi>Petulca</hi> amazed to hear her ſay this, and knowing her by her voyce to be the ſame <hi>Briſil</hi> that ſojourned among the ſhepheards of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at length burſt out into theſe words, Ah gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, the Gods know that I have not forgotten neither you nor <hi>Periander,</hi> who under the name of <hi>Sybil,</hi> in the habit of a ſhepheard, bearing title to be your ſiſter, hath cauſed my grief, and forced me to undertake this troubleſome journey, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding never to return home till I have found him, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know the Treaſon and malicious dealing of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorena</hi> and <hi>Bergama,</hi> to exhort him to race out the falſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſuſpition which he hath grounded in the bottome of his heart of your diſloyalty. For ſéeing that for my ſake he hath been ſo horribly abuſed and brought into that errour; I will hazard my life to reſtore him unto his former eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to the end that he may enjoy you, and your ſelf to him.

And therefore ſéeing that I had not as yet underſtood (having enquired of the Lady <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> Nymphs of your calling) any other thing of you but that you were a certain Princeſſe of <hi>Albion,</hi> and that we ſhould ſhortly hear of the cauſe of your comming, and more largely know the courſe of your fortune; I hope your Grace will not think the worſe of me, who have vowed my body and life to do ſervice unto your loving <hi>Periander,</hi> what ſtate or calling ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be of. Thanks kind <hi>Petulca</hi> (quoth the Duches) and perſwade thy ſelf that I think no otherwiſe of thée then I did at any time. And to the end that thou mayſt underſtand the truth and verity of all my troubles, and know what <hi>Periander</hi> is, and alſo what cauſed him to fain himſelf to be my ſiſter, being attired in ſhepheards attire, I will briefly and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe unto thee in this good company of ſhepheards (ſo I be not troubleſome unto them) the whole ſtate of my fortune. But firſt I muſt intreat you to tell me how long you have béen here, when you departed from the village, and what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe you have had in your journey.</p>
               <p>Then may it pleaſe you to underſtand (quoth <hi>Petulca</hi>) that after the malicious traitreſſe <hi>Malorena</hi> had caſt her ſelf into the river to take penance for her heinous offence, by her own appointment, the whole Village was made acquainted with her villany deteſting her for her malice, and marvelling at <hi>Periander</hi> and your ſelf for your perfect love, in marvellous manner mourning for his departure and your miſhap. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the chiefeſt of the village ſent for me to underſtand the truth of the whole matter; which when I had declared, they took order with me that I ſhould ſpeak with you, and comfort you, letting you know what they had appointed to do in your behalf; for they intended to make enquiry through all the country after <hi>Periander,</hi> to the end that he might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all that had hapned in the Village concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Malorena,</hi> and ſo be induced to return again unto you, knowing the ſayings of <hi>Malorena</hi> to be falſe, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:165993:85"/> by her peſtiferous brain. Whereupon I, moſt ready to do any thing that might redownd to your content, betimes the next morning went to your lodging, but there I found you not, nor could learn of any one of your Neighbours what was become of you; whereof how ſorry I was, I leave to the Gods to witneſs, and not I onely but the whole Village, moſt grievouſly lamented your ſodain departure. At length I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to reſt in any place till I had found <hi>Periander,</hi> and let him know how he had been abuſed by <hi>Malorena,</hi> and how you were injured by him, in that he giving credit to ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious maid, leſt you to paſſe your life in ſuch diſcontent and grief for his cauſe. To the end that if Fortune had been ſo fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as to deprive him of your company for ever, by ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hap yet he ſhould know how faithfully you loved him, ſéeing that your loyalty was knowne unto the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Whereupon I having firſt cauſed diſſembling <hi>Bergama</hi> as an inſtrument and helping cauſe of this miſchief, to be baniſhed, until ſuch time as <hi>Periander</hi> and you were together and conſented to have her releaſed from exile, I betook my ſelf to my journey, and having travelled two dayes and two nights, at laſt I arrived in a Country houſe, where I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteouſly uſed by a certain ſhepheard, who took pleaſure to talk with me concerning the cauſe of my comming, for that he had himſelf not paſſing eight year ſince, almoſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over the world to ſeek his wife, which was carried away upon a certain time by a Duke that riding that way, cauſed his men to take her with them, he being abroad in the field. And that after he had taken ſo much paines, it was his luck at length to come to the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> where the Lady <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> dwelleth, who helped him to his wife again. Therefore the ſhepheard having entertained and feaſted me very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and bountifully, ſet me into a way which directly brought me to this place aſſuring me that I ſhould of this Lady be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all matters concerning thoſe that I ſought for; as in truth I have found his words not diſagréeing unto verity; For being arrived here two dayes ſince, the Lady welcomed
<pb facs="tcp:165993:86"/> me not as a ſimple Shepheard, but rather like ſome worthy perſon of high eſtate (which I perceive ſhe did in reſpect of your excellency and not of my deſert) and willing me to ſtay in her Palace till ſuch time as ſhe might learn news concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſe of my comming, promiſed me that I ſhould not ſtay in vaine, which I have tried to be ſo, ſéeing that you are ſo happily arrived to this place, as I hope alſo by the favour of the Gods, and the help of ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> to ſée <hi>Periander,</hi> if not here, yet in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>Thus Madame have you heard what is paſſed ſithence the time that I ſaw you laſt, now it remaineth that it may pleaſe you to accompliſh your promiſe.

Inſomuch that being weary of travel, he was forced to lie on the ground among the wild furzen buſhes and thornes to reſt himſelf, where he ſlept till morning, at which time awaking out of his ſléep, he ſaw a certain <hi>Albion</hi> Knight ſtand before him, whom he knew very well, for he was his fathers Taſter, and was called Sir <hi>Pharelus;</hi> whereat <hi>Periander</hi> was ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb facs="tcp:165993:86"/> that he could not tell what had befallen him; but the Knight ſpake preſently in this manner.</p>
               <p>Fair Shepheard or Nymph (for <hi>Periander</hi> had his womans attire yet) whatſoever thou be, be not diſpleaſed that I have emboldned my ſelf to preſſe ſo néer the place where you ſlept, for ſeeing that I was loth to wake you out of your ſound ſleep and wiſhed to ſpeak with you, I thought beſt to ſtay till you awaked of your owne accord; therefore ſeeing you have given over your ſleep, I beſeech you to ſhew me what way I may take to get out of this huge wood in which I have ſore againſt my will remained three dayes, not finding any way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the ſame. <hi>Periander</hi> glad that Sir <hi>Pharelus</hi> knew him not gave him this anſwer: Sir Knight, I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſpleaſed at you, ſeeing that I my ſelf would in the like caſe have uſed as much boldneſſe; I am no Nymph, yet if I could pleaſure you and ſatisfie your demand, I would the willinger do it, conſidering that I would think my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him that would ſhew us the way out of this Wood; For yeſterday about the decline of the Sun, did I firſt enter into it, having travelled this way never before; and ſeeing I could not finde the way out again, having loſt my path, the weariſomneſſe of my journey forced me to take my reſt. But pray you Sir (if I may be ſo bold) what luck hath brought you hither, for I perceive by the ſtrangeneſs of your apparel, that you are of ſome countrey afar off, ſeeing that no Gencle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hereabout are cloathed after ſuch a faſhion. In truth (quoth <hi>Pharelus</hi>) it was ill luck brought me hither fair ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, for you ſhall know that I am a <hi>Brittain,</hi> born in the Iſle of <hi>Albion,</hi> and left my Countrey by the command of our King who being informed by Letters from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that his ſon the young Prince of <hi>Albion</hi> was broken out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fled (for he was impriſoned in <hi>Sivil</hi> by his fathers command) ſent me into <hi>Spain,</hi> to enquire after him, and not to return till I had heard of him. But when I was arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> I heard that the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> daughter <hi>Florena</hi> went with him, or after him, but no man could tell me whether ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:87"/> were by him, or had not yet found him, or what way he was gone. Thus I have travelled up and down <hi>Spain,</hi> and have not as yet diſcovered any more news of him. In truth (quoth <hi>Periander</hi>) I heard great talk in our village, of the Kings daughter <hi>Florena,</hi> how ſhe was conveyed out of the Court by another Kings ſon (I know not of what Countrey) that was impriſoned as you ſay by his own fathers command, becauſe he would be married to a young Ducheſſe whom the King himſelf would have to his wife. True (quoth <hi>Pharelus</hi>) but the Ducheſſe about three or four days before the appointed Wedding day ſecretly fled out of the country no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whither; which the King took ſo grievouſly, that partly for danger &amp; partly for grief, he kept his chamber ſix weeks, at the end of which time he received letters from the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> in which he underſtood of his ſons flight, which news almoſt ſet him beſides his wits; for he had purpoſed to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Spain</hi> for his ſon, and to proclaim the Ducheſſe that was fled, Queen of <hi>England:</hi> and wife to his ſon <hi>Periander,</hi> unto whom he intended to reſign the title of the Crown, and to marry him to the aforeſaid Duches, with whom he was promiſed many years before. Therefore ſeeing that Fortune ſo croſſed him, fell into a grievous and dangerous diſeaſe, inſomuch that we doubted of his recovery. But after he had kept his bed one fortnight, by the ſingular skill and induſtry of the Phyſitians, he began to mend; and calling me one morning to his beds ſide, uttered theſe words unto me. Ah <hi>Pharelus,</hi> thou ſeeſt how pittifully your King hath been uſed both by Fortune and Heaven; for the Gods intending to revenge my unnatural crueltie and barbarous tyranny againſt mine own ſon, though I repented, yet would both bar me from my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and puniſh my offence. But now, as I féel by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my weakneſſe, that they have ſlaked their vengeance, and pitie my caſe, ſo I hope Fortune will in like manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more favourable than hitherto ſhe hath been. You know how the Ducheſſe <hi>Briſil</hi> is fled, and no news can be heard what is become of the poor Lady. In like manner now
<pb facs="tcp:165993:87"/> is <hi>Periander</hi> alſo broken out of priſon, and as a baniſhed man runneth aſtray, perhaps ſuffering a thouſand miſeries, and all for fear leſt he ſhould fall into my hands, where alas I would rather ask him forgiveneſſe, then any way prejudice him ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath no way offended me, but I greatly injured him. And now for as much as the hold of my life conſiſteth in the hope which I have to ſee both <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Briſil</hi> here in my Court; I have cauſed thee to come hither, to declare my mind unto thee concerning this matter, wherein I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thy ſervice, ſeeing I have found thee faithful and loyall in all matters which I ever committed to thy truſt, not doubting but that I ſhall finde thee as ready now to do me pleaſure and acquite my ſelf of your duty, as I have been at other times. My pleaſure is that thou make a voyage into Spain, and paſſe over all that country to ſée whether you can hear of my ſon <hi>Periander,</hi> to the end, that if you find him, you may let him know how earneſtly I wiſh to ſee him, that he may come hither, and receive the Crown of the Realm. And if it chance Ducheſſe <hi>Briſil</hi> be in thoſe parts (for it may be ſhe is with him or in travel to ſéek him) inſomuch that you meet with her or hear of her. I would have order taken, that ſhe notwithſtanding that <hi>Periander</hi> be not yet found, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Court to be crowned Queen, ſéeing that the Crown by the law of the Realme apperteineth unto her after my death, being betrothed to my ſon if he marry no other, as I know he will not, I will ſend others to other Countries you ſhall onely ſéek them in Spain. I pray you to do all the diligence you can, and to behave your ſelf herein according to the opinion I bear of you. And for your reward if you find either of them, I will promiſe you leſſe then I wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. And eſpecially this I will ſay before hand, that he that findeth and bringeth <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Briſil</hi> both, as ſoon as they arrive at the Court, I will give him the iſle <hi>Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:165993:88"/> at my hands if the Gods will favour your journey, yet what luck ſoever you have, I will not be unmindful of your labour and readineſſe.</p>
               <p>Therewith the King weary by reaſon of his ſickneſſe, and ſcarce able to ſpeak more, ceaſed, and I thanking his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty for his ſingular favour towards me, vowed to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lay in me to the uttermoſt of my power, partly for my duty towards him, and partly for the love I bear the young Prince. Inſomuch that after we had fully concluded the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I departed from <hi>Albion</hi> the next day with twelve men, which I have all ſent to ſundry places of this country, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to meet all at the famous City <hi>Leon,</hi> ſituated along the River <hi>Eyla,</hi> as the ſixt day after to morrow at which time I mean to be there by the help of the Gods, to know what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they can bring me. Verily ſir Knight (quoth <hi>Periander</hi>) the Kings ſon would wiſh to meet with you, if he knew the good tidings you bring him; I am grieved my ſelfe to heare that ſuch great perſons are ſubject to ſo much adverſity. But I pray fair ſhepheard (quoth <hi>Pharelus</hi>) ſéeing you ſay you have heard talk of him in your Village to tell me where the ſame vilage is, and how it is called; for if I thought I might there hear any thing of him, I would take my journey that way. More then I have ſaid (quoth <hi>Periander</hi>) ſhall you not heare there I promiſe you, and therfore ſéeing it is out of your way, take not the pains. And as they were thus talking together, they eſpied an old man wandring through the wood ſo far from them that they could ſcarce ſée him by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the buſhes and ſmall trees that grew in the wood. But cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unto him, he fearing leſt they had meant to do him ſome harm, began to run away as faſt as his old leggs could carry him. But <hi>Pharelus</hi> with all celerity followed him ſo long till he overtook him at laſt at the wood end, having run a whole hour before he could come to him, the old fellow ſo beſtirred his ſtumps, and ſéeing he could not outrun him, he fell downe on his knées and asked for mercy, making a large apologie that he was a poor old man and had a wife and children to kéep
<pb facs="tcp:165993:88"/> and many good morrows, fearing that he ſhould have been rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Pharelus,</hi> which he perceiving, could not but laugh to ſée the old man ſo timerous; and therefore ſaid, Alack good Father, fear not, for though I perceive by thy fearfulneſſe that thou art well provided of money, yet I called thee not for thy wealth, but for thy counſell, for I have been here in this Wood theſe three dayes and more, and cannot find any path to lead me out of the ſame. And though I perceive that by following thee I have attained to that which I wiſhed for, ſeeing I am here at the wood end, yet I thought good to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee out of the opinion which thou conceiveſt of me, who wiſh thee no harme: Nevertheleſſe, ſeeing I do not well know where I am, thou ſhalt do me a pleaſure to tell me what way I may beſt take towards the famous City <hi>Leon.</hi> Ah good Gentleman (anſwered the old fellow) the cauſe that I ran from you, was not for fear to looſe any treaſure, for I have none; but I heard that there was a poor man ſlain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix weeks ago in this wood, and ſeeing I knew you not, I hope you will not think the worſe of me though I was afraid of you. As concerning your requeſt, knew, that I dwell in the ſame City you enquire for, and if you dain to travel in the company of ſuch an homely perſon as my ſelf, by the help of the Gods I will lead you thither before three dayes come to an end. Willingly (quoth <hi>Pharelus</hi>) and I thank thee for thy courteous offer, but there is a young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe that followed me as I ran after thee, of whom I asked the way, and alas ſhe knew it as little as I, and I would be ſorry that we ſhould leave her behind us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray thee to ſtay here a little, and I will ſee whether I can eſpy her comming. But if you be wiſe (quoth the old man) go not in too deep, leſt you loſe your way again, it were beſt for you to call unto her as loud as you can, or to whiſtle, for if ſhe hear you ſhe will come, and if ſhe be cut of hearing, you may chance to ſeek after her as long as you have already been in the wood. <hi>Pharelus</hi> followed his counſel, and whooped unto her as loud as he might, and ſeeing that ſhe came not,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:89"/> after he had remained there for the ſpace of two hourrs, the old man being very haſty to go on his journey, he would not ſtay behind, and omit that opportunity, though loth, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the ſhepheard, he went with the old man. <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> on the other ſide, who for his woman-like ſhepheard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, could not follow <hi>Pharelus</hi> when he ran after the old man, (for his long coat catched by the thornes and brambles) and having loſt the ſight of <hi>Pharelus,</hi> went quite another way; ſo that it was no marvel that he heard not <hi>Pharelus</hi> call unto him; for he went quite contrary from the path which <hi>Pharelus</hi> took after the old man, and came out at the other end of the wood, where ſéeing himſelf out of the troubleſom Forreſt, was grieved that he had loſt <hi>Pharelus</hi> in that ſort, before he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved whether he would reveale himſelf unto him or no, but yet remembring that <hi>Pharelus</hi> ſaid he meant to be at <hi>Leon</hi> within ſix days, he was the gladder, ſéeing wher he knew to find him, if he concluded to return with him to <hi>Albion;</hi> Inſomuch that ſitting down on a bank by the wood ſide, began in this manner.</p>
               <p>Ah unfortunate <hi>Periander,</hi> now mayſt thou well perceive that Fortune hath ſworn to be thy enemy for ever.

               <p>Inſomuch that I ſtrive againſt the ſtream, and caſt ſtones againſt the wind, in oppoſing my ſelf againſt fortune ſeeing ſhe hath vowed my utter ruine, and will bring her will to paſſe.

Yet <hi>Periander</hi> how canſt thou ſo greatly complain of her, ſéeing that ſhe ſo favoureth thée, that thy father, who was thy foe, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thy friend; thou that wert but a Kings ſon, art now when thou wilt a King; and where thou didſt live in impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, in exile, and miſery, maiſt now live in Court, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and in all the pleaſure of the world? No, no, fond fool, fortune doth not this, but the juſt Gods, and if ſhe be any cauſe of it ſhe doth it onely thereby to entice me to become as diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as <hi>Briſil,</hi> and ſo wholly to vanquiſh and overcome me. But no, though I have acknowledged her to be never ſo puiſſant, yet ſhe ſhall not make conqueſt of my fidelity, nor brag of my diſloyalty, ſéeeing, I will not, nor may give over the love of <hi>Briſil;</hi> and thought ſhe neglect and hate me, yet will I love and honour her till death.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Periander</hi> had thus lamented the loſſe of the love of
<pb facs="tcp:165993:90"/> 
                  <hi>Briſil,</hi> he determined to go to the City <hi>Leon</hi> to méet with Sir <hi>Pharelus,</hi> and with him to return to <hi>Albion,</hi> intending to live there and enjoy his Fathers Crown; but never to love any but <hi>Briſil,</hi> or to knit himſelfe in marriage to any other. And reſolved to take his journey by the ſame village where he left <hi>Briſil,</hi> meaning to ſpeak with <hi>Malorena,</hi> and to leave a Letter with her for <hi>Briſil,</hi> as he had done before: in which Letter he purpoſed to let <hi>Briſil</hi> know of all that which he had learned of <hi>Pharelus,</hi> wohm he found and loſt in the wood. He intended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to write a Letter to <hi>Petulca,</hi> and to let him know as much, proteſting that if hee would come into <hi>Albion</hi> when hee were Crowned, he would give him the Dukedome pertaining unto <hi>Briſil</hi> in marriage with her, and doe him all the honour that a Monarch might do to any of his Péers, ſeeing that <hi>Briſil</hi> made ſuch account of him. In this mind <hi>Periander</hi> returned ſecretly unto the village where he had ſojourned with <hi>Briſil,</hi> and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his attire, apparelled himſelfe in mans cloathes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſex and nature. And being come to the village he tooke his lodging in a ſhepheards houſe, where he thought he was leaſt of all known. When he had entred into the houſe, and cauſed ſupper to be made ready, he asked one of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards daughters, whether they knew not a certain ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe called <hi>Malorena,</hi> (for he thought to have ſpoken with her, and to know of her how <hi>Petulca</hi> and <hi>Briſil</hi> were moved at his departure, &amp; to leave the Letters which he purpoſed to write, with her, to deliver them to <hi>Briſil</hi> and <hi>Petulca</hi>) wherewith they were halfe angry, thinking he did it to have occaſion to ſpeak ill of the maids and ſhepheards of their country, and therefore gave him this anſwer. We knew her, but too well, and if we thought you were one of her favourites, you ſhould have but had lodging here. Pardon me (fair ſhepheards, replied <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) if I offend againſt my knowledg, for the cauſe that I ask for her, is that I am her couſin, &amp; have not ſéen her this great while: I as yet have never heard any ill of her, nor ever knew any thing by her, but that ſhe behaved her ſelf as a maid of her calling ought to do. Thereby (quoth the ſhepheards wife) we
<pb facs="tcp:165993:90"/> perceive thee to be but a ſtranger here, and therefore to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; for as you ſay, ſhe was famed for one of the moſt modeſt maids of the whole country, but now of late ſhe hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great villany againſt two of the loyalleſt lovers that ever the world harboured. And thus the good wife declared the ſum of the whole matter unto <hi>Peaiander,</hi> how all things were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which ſo altered his affections, that all they that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent could perceive that he was moved thereby. Yet leaſt he ſhould bewray who he was, forced himſelf as much as he could to abſtain from ſighing or weeping til he was alone, at which time he poured forth whole flouds of tears out of his eys, for grief that he had ſhamefully ſuffered himſelf to be deluded by <hi>Malorena,</hi> and thereby brought himſelf into all theſe miſeries, where otherwiſe he ſhould have béen the happieſt man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Nevertheleſſe when he had heard what moan <hi>Brſil</hi> had made for his ſudden departure, and how that ſhe was gone to ſéek him he was joyfull and glad, accounting more of her Love and loyalty, then all other things whatſoever. Thus <hi>Periander</hi> both ſorry and glad, wiſt not what he might beſt do, to ſéek for <hi>Briſil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or to go to <hi>Leon</hi> firſt, and ſpeak with <hi>Pharelus.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that it were a moſt uncertain voyage, and doubtfull labour to ſtray after her, he concluded to goe to <hi>Pharelus</hi> firſt, and with all ſpéede to returne to <hi>Albion,</hi> where after he were crowned King, he doubted not, but that ſhe would come unto him, aſſoon as ſhe ſhould be informed thereof. Beſides, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſend ſo many to enquire after her, that in deſpight of Fortune, he ſhould hear of her, or ſhe of him, eſpecially ſéeing ſhe ſought for him, which was the chiefeſt point that encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Periander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He therefore having his head full of Bees, and building ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the aire, ſlept a little that night, and riſing betimes in the morning, took leave of the ſhepheard, paying and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that which could be asked for his lodging and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, departed towards the City <hi>Leon,</hi> where he arrived two days after <hi>Pharelus.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eriander</hi> (though hee knew not where hee might find <hi>Pharelus,</hi> or how to inquire for him, yet hee) had ſuch good luck and fortune, that walking in the Market-place, hee eſpied <hi>Pharelus</hi> talking with one of the men whom hee had appointed to meet him there: whereupon <hi>Periander</hi> ſtepping to him, courteouſly ſaluted him, ſaying. Sir Knight the cauſe of my comming unto you, being unknown is this. About two days ago, I met with a certain ſhepheardeſſe, who told me that ſhe underſtood of you, that you ſought for the King of <hi>Albions</hi> ſonne that was impriſoned in <hi>Spain,</hi> and breaking forth ran away as ſome ſay with the Kings Daughter, though others rather think without her. And for as much as I have heard ſome certainty concerning this young Prince, where he is, &amp; other matters touching a certain Dutcheſs that ſhould be his wife or alliance, I thought good to let you know ſo much as I have heard, But if it will pleaſe you to go with me half a mile without the City, I will lead you into a ſhepheards houſe, where I doubt not but you ſhall underſtand as much as ſhall content you, and ſerve to bring you unto the thing you moſt wiſh for. Sir <hi>Pharelus</hi> hearing this young man (as little thinking that he ſhould be <hi>Periander,</hi> as he did when he met him in the wood in womans apparel) thanked him with a moſt pleaſant countenance, rejoycing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly for the hope hee had to find <hi>Periander;</hi> and preſently without returning to his lodging, hee went with him out of the City towards the place he ſpake of. <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing Sir <hi>Pharelus</hi> ſo merry for the news he had brought him, and ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe with him, conceived great joy that he had ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:165993:91"/> a ſubject; and leading him out of the City, when he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cloſe ſomething far from any houſe, where he thought he might ſpeak ſafely and not be heard or ſéen of any man but ſir <hi>Pharelus</hi> who was onely by him: (for he had left his man in the market-place of the City, there to expect the comming of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he looked for) he thought good to reveal unto ſir <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relus</hi> who he was, and therefore ſaid thus, <hi>Pharelus</hi> we are are now come far enough, I mean to go no further, and I thank thee that thou haſt done ſo much for me as to come thus far with me, when I am King of <hi>Albion,</hi> I will do more for thee. <hi>Pharelus</hi> amazed at theſe words wiſt not what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to give him, and although at the firſt he thought he had mocked with him. ſaying, that he thanked him for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far with him, yet when he heard him ſpeak of his being King of <hi>Albion,</hi> perceived that it was <hi>Periander</hi> himſelf, for joy whereof, he could ſcarce ſpeak, but falling down on his knees craved pardon of <hi>Periander</hi> for his ill remembrance. But <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> imbracing him, took him up by the hand, and thanked him for his loyal ſervice, ſaying that he was ſo mindful of him that he ſhould be beholding unto him for ever. For (quoth he) how may I find fault with thy remembrance <hi>Pharelus,</hi> ſéeing thou daily takeſt ſuch care about me, and ſuffereſt ſo much toil to ſéek me? As for the outward remembrance, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth onely in the favour and colour of the face, ſéeing the ſame is by continuance of time changed and altered, it is a hard matter to bear memory thereof, eſpecially when it is eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with unacquainted and ſtrange attire. Or elſe no doubt <hi>Pharelus,</hi> but you that think on me dayly would have known me, not onely when I came to you in the market-place of this city <hi>Leon,</hi> but alſo when you feared to wake me in the wood, where we were ſo ſtrangely ſeparated one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I know not by what miſchaunce, but that (the Gods be thanked it happened greatly to my comfort,</p>
               <p>Herewith <hi>Periander</hi> informed <hi>Pharelus</hi> of all whatſoever had hapned unto him, ſince his departure from <hi>Albion,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Briſils</hi> comming unto him in the priſon, her departure
<pb facs="tcp:165993:92"/> with him, their abode, and manner of abode among the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards: and laſtly of <hi>Briſils</hi> laſt departure, greatly lamenting her abſence, making great ſorrow for her, that ſhe now went aſtray up and down through the unknown and ſolitary places of that deſart part of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeek him. <hi>Pharelus</hi> glad to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole matter, though grievouſly ſorry for the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Briſils</hi> miſhap, comforted <hi>Periander</hi> by all the means he could, hoping by that they had been in <hi>Albion</hi> but a moneth or twain, they ſhould hear of her.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Pharelus</hi> had a long time talked of all matters concerning their return to <hi>Albion,</hi> they went back to the City again, where they met with thoſe whom <hi>Pharelus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that day: who being come according to his appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, each told as much as he had heard concerning <hi>Periander,</hi> which was but little: nevertheleſſe he thanked them all for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and induſtry, telling them that hee had better newes himſelf, and ſuch newes that he minded to return into <hi>Albion,</hi> where he doubted not, but that he ſhould find <hi>Periander,</hi> if the Gods would be ſo favourable as he hoped; but would leave them to inquire and ſéek for the Dutcheſs <hi>Briſil,</hi> who was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in that part of <hi>Spain</hi> where they were. The men glad to ſée their Maſter ſo frolick and merry for the good nws which he had heard, promiſed that they would do as much as lay in their power according to their duty, and as they had already done. But marvelling what young man he was that ſtood by their maſter (for they had never ſéen <hi>Periander</hi> to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg) asked their maſter, whether that young man had brought him thoſe happy tidings? <hi>Pharelus</hi> unwilling that they ſhould know that he was <hi>Periander,</hi> told them that he was ſo, and that he would lead him into <hi>Albion</hi> with him, to the end that if his newes were true, he might reward him accordingly as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pharelus</hi> ſpéedily appointing them what way each ſhould take, willed them to make diligent ſearch for her, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that ſhe was in thoſe parts, and that the ſame young man that was by him had ſeen her not long before, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled
<pb facs="tcp:165993:92"/> like a ſhepheard and countrey maid. Beſides he charged them to tell her if they met her, what was paſſed in the Court of <hi>Albion</hi> before their departure, and that ſithence ſhe ſaw <hi>Periander</hi> laſt, that he hath béen at the village where he left her, and there béen informed of the deceitfulneſſe of <hi>Bergama,</hi> of her own faithfulneſſe and loyalty, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters concerning the traitreſſe <hi>Malorena;</hi> and that he is either in <hi>Albion,</hi> or ſhortly ſhall be, where he will expect her comming. Herewith <hi>Pharelus</hi> diſpatched them all, and leaving them each one to look to his charge, preſently repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his lodging with <hi>Periander,</hi> where they refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being both hungry and weary. Their repaſt being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they took directions for their readieſt way towards the Haven of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> intending there to take ſhip. And ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Leon,</hi> they travelled along the river <hi>Ezla,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the village where <hi>Periander</hi> had ſojourned with <hi>Briſil</hi> on the left hand, Where we will leave them going on their journey, and return to <hi>Briſil,</hi> whom we left rehearſing the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of her life, to the ſhepheard <hi>Petulca</hi> and <hi>Philorenus,</hi> with the reſt of their company.</p>

               <p>I was born in a little village called <hi>Yervedra</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Aragon;</hi> my parents were poor and of baſe linage, and lead their lives altogether in the Country, their name or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred being of no honour or fame for nobility of diſcent though they were known and ſpoken of in places farre from them, through the whole Kingdome of <hi>Aragon</hi> for their vertue and honeſty.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:93"/> began to lowre and frown on the good and luckie eſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which my father and mother lived, having ſtore of wealth, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ge. For it happened that occaſion of Wars and Diſcord growing betwéene the Kings of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> both their Armies were encamped by our village, inſomuch that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and moſt of his Neighbours, to avoid the loſſe they were like to ſuſtain by the incurſion of their enemies, thought beſt to leave their country habitation til the times changed, and to ſojourn in ſome of the next Cities until the wars were ended. To bring which thing to paſſe, my father ſpéedily travelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City <hi>Targonna,</hi> there to provide ſome houſe for his wife and him, there to expect the end of the preſent troubles, intending, if he could find any convenient place for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to return home and fetch my mother and me with the reſt of the family. But within one day after his departure, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the two armies buckled together, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie becomming victorious, purſued our King that fled with all his Nobility through our Village, to ſave himſelf in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid City of <hi>Targonna,</hi> ſéeing his Campe was diſcomfited his chiefeſt Captains ſlain and all his Souldiers chaſed by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and put to their ſhifts, having more hope in their héels then in their hands, Inſomuch that the whole Army of the K, of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſwarming about our Village as a company of Bées, pillaged and ſpoyled all the houſes and farms taking the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt farmers and husbandmen for their priſoners, ſetting them each one at ſuch a rate or ſum of money for their ranſome, as they thought them able to pay, according to the ſubſtance and wealth which they judged them to have.</p>

                  </gap>uſe, and asking for my father, the maids anſwered, that hee was in the City: but he not beleeving them, ran into all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the houſe, to ſée whether he were not hidden in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place: and as he ranged up &amp; down through all the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, at length he found my mother lying under one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards beds, and pulling her out by the hand, when he ſaw the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:94"/> decent proportion of her body, the comlineſſe of her face, and gravity of her countenance, he was on the ſuddain ſo ſnared in the net of fanſie, that he felt himſelf not a conquerour, but conquered; and ſpake unto her in this order. Beautifull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron (for I perceive you are the Miſtreſſe of this houſhold) the pleaſant weapons wherewith you fight hath given me ſuch a ſoothing wound, that although it hath penetrated the very depth of my heart, and yéelded me thy captive, whereas I was in the number of thoſe that this day boaſt of victory, yet I am forced to confeſſe, that fortune hath not a little favoured me, in that it was my hap to be overcome by ſo ſweet an enemy as your ſelf. Fear not therefore ſwéet, for I am not come hither to do thee or thy family any wrong, but to do thée pleaſure and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Wherewith he eſpying his ſouldiers buſie with raping and pilfering, pocketing, and bagging up ſuch things as they liked beſt, commanded them to ceaſe, and to ſéek their booty elſewhere; and appointing ſome of them to free the houſe from the incurſions of other captains and ſouldiers, he returned unto my mother, who could not ſufficiently lament our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that we were not by my father in the City, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the loſſe of all her goods, but the danger unto which her honeſty was expoſed. The Captain therefore perceiving her ſo greeved, began again in this ſort to comfort her. Brave dame, I beſéech you do not afflict your ſelf, ſéeing you have no cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where you ſée among your neighbours not one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the fury of the ſouldier, who ſpoileth them of all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of their jewels, of their cattell, of their beaſts, of their deareſt houſhold-ſtuff, burneth their houſes, and taketh the Matrons priſoners, and plagueth them with all kind of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like injury; you contrarily have not ſo much as a broom-ſtaff removed out of your houſe. And although your husband were here, as it ſeemeth he is not, yet ſhould he not have one hair of his head impaired. For whatſoever I promiſe, I ſwear unto you by the faith of a Gentleman and ſouldier, that I will perform no leſſe. And therefore I pray you ceaſe from weeping, and waſh not your cheeks with your tears, bath
<pb facs="tcp:165993:94"/> not your ſelf in water which is procured with ſo much grief.</p>
               <p>All this could not perſwade my wofull mother to give over her ſorrow, or to aſſwage her grief; for ſhe well knew that when the Syrens ſing moſt ſweetly, they intend moſt harme; that when the fowler whiſtleth moſt pleaſantly, he wiſheth the birds moſt miſery; and that the fox never praiſed the hens, but when he aimed at the cock, and ſo did ſhe more then misdoubt that theſe words of the captain tended to no other purpoſe but to crop the bloom of her Honeſty, and to become Lord of her Beauty.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this ſo overwhelmed her with excéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrow, that ſhe ceaſed not from wéeping for all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains prattle, nor would ſhee give him one word in anſwer to his ſayings. Nevertheleſſe hee bore her frowardneſſe ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that he changed not his former tune, but rather continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſweet and mild ſpeeches, trying by all means he could to aſſwage her dolour, and to provoke her to accept of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and friendſhip, uſing her ſo courteouſly, that he ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſome eſpecial friend, then deſtroying enemy. For though my mother well marked the cauſe which moved him to uſe ſuch favourable enmitie, and eſpied that he was caught in the ſnare of her beauty, yet could ſhe not ſufficiently wonder at his modeſty, wherewith he ſought to cover and cloak his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; for though he revealed it unto her at the firſt, yet he did not ſo much as offer her the leaſt diſgrace in the world, neither by word nor deedr</p>
               <p>In the mean while the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (who in proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had purſued his enemy our King, who having reached to the Wals of the City, was freed by the help of the Cannon, which forbad the enemy to approach near) returning againe through our village, being weary, and ſeeing no houſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him ſo well as ours (for the moſt part of our neighbours houſes were burned) lighted from off his horſe, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall, where he found the Captain by my mother, who wept ſo bitterly, that it might have moved any heart to cem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. But the King wondring to ſee her in ſuch a wofull
<pb facs="tcp:165993:95"/> caſe, and yet marked that her houſe was ſo trim and all things in as good order as if no ſouldiers had béen near it, asked the Captain what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman ailed I ſorry of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings coming, yet ſéeing there was no remedy ſith it chanced ſo, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Dread Soveraign (qd. he) it was my hap to light on this houſe, where at my entry, I found this Matron being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of this family, and beholding her beauty and modeſt plight, I forced my ſelf to give over the rigorous manner of war, and to uſe her according to her deſerts, whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and comely grace hath priviledged her from the fury of my ſouldiers, inſomuch that they have not by mee béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to do her the leaſt danger that may be. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth ſhe weep and make ſuch grief as if ſhe were worſe uſed then all the reſt of her neighbours, that have not onely loſt their goods but alſo their husbands and children, yea and their honeſty being violated and raviſhed by the common anercenary ſouldiers. Therefore mighty conquerour, what ſhe ayleth or what cauſe ſhe hath to take on in this manner, it paſſeth my divination to conjecture. Why then (quoth the King) I pray thee yeeld over thy captive unto me, and I will give thee two of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt noblemen captives of the K. of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> that I have taken in this flight, in lieu of her: and let me try whether I cannot find better means to flake her grief and procure her ſolace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt don. As they were buſie about changing of captives, news was brought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enemy flocked out of the City being an huge and mighty company, marching toward the place where he was; whereat the King amazed, cauſed the chiefeſt Marſhal of his army to call up the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and to place them in battell aray to withſtand their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but all in vain; for the ſouldiers ſtrayed ſo wide to ſéek their booty, and to benefit themſelves with the ſpoil, that if they had not in time plaid <hi>ſcampado,</hi> they had béen every man ſlain. Which the King perceiving, mounting on his Steed, and loth to leave his new captive behind him, cauſed my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſet behind one of his Noblemen and ſo they poſted away, where I poor wretch bawled as children of that age I
<pb facs="tcp:165993:95"/> then was in, being about four years old, are accuſtomed to do when they be ſeparated from their mother. My father deſirous to know how we fared in the midſt of the enemy, ſnatched oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the fore-head and went forth of <hi>Targonna</hi> with them that purſued the enemy, and comming home, marvelled to ſée the houſe in ſo good eſtate; but miſſing my mother, asked what was become of her, which he ſoon knew by my crying, who ſaid my mother was carried away by the Souldiers. Whereat he was ſo moved, as you may well conſider how any man might be cheared in ſuch a caſe, and therefore I will not waſte the time in declaring what excéeding ſorrow my father made for the abſence of his wife, reſolving to hazard his life to have her again.</p>
               <p>But alas, the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> being fled to a Caſtle which he had won not paſſing four or five days before, ſaved himſelf within the walls of the ſame, from the fury of his enemy that ceaſed not to purſue him; and ſo my father ſaw no way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his deſire, ſéeing my mother was within the aforeſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which was ſo ſtrong that it could not be eaſily incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our men, who aſſailed it fiercely but to no purpoſe: for the ſouldiers that were ſcattered in the ſlight, met together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a league from the Caſtle, and having rallied themſelves, in the night time brake into our camp, making great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among our men, and although they could not diſcomfit our men, yet they got within the walls of the Caſtle, and were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the reſt of their company, in ſo much that our men had no hope to win the Caſtle, and ſo departed towards the City, which my father took very heavily, ſéeing he was cut from his wife; and ſo he returned home very mournfully, imagining &amp; inventing how he might have my mother again, &amp; redéem her from captivity, though it ſhould have coſt him all whatſoever he might make with the ſale of his goods. Yet his hope was but ſmal to get her again for any price, ſéeing the maids &amp; ſervants of the houſe had told him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was carried away by the Kings command, and declared unto him how all things were paſſed, touching the friendly hoſtility of the Captain, the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:96"/> the changing of captives, and all other things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the carrying away of their miſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time my mother, whom the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſolicited to diſhoneſty, was moſt miſerably tormented and grieved, that her fortune was ſo adverſe, that ſhe was in the hands of him that might force her to do that which he pleaſed, though the laws of God, nature, and the country, were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it. But ſhe purpoſed rather to die, then to conſent to his lewd will, and to eſteem more of her chaſtity, then his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though ſhe were but a mean perſon, and he a King; loth to change her honeſty for his Kingdome.</p>

Nevertheleſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the worſt that might happen was, that ſhe ſhould be abuſed but by a Captain, where otherwiſe ſhe ſhould remain
<pb facs="tcp:165993:96"/> ſubject to the luſt and riot of a King, making caſe of the vice, and not regarding the perſons, ſhe reſolved to follow the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains counſell, thinking that it might as well prove for her benefit as contrarily, where if ſhe remained with the King ſhe could not hope for amendment, ſéeing luſt cannot be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by virtue, but rather inflamed and ſtirred up to further wickedneſſe. The Captain hearing her willing to uſe his help, told her that the King intended the next day after to ride to another Caſtle, where he purpoſed to muſter his army, and to beſiege the City <hi>Targonna,</hi> but meant to let him be as chief governour of the Caſtle: therefore he willed her to feign that ſhe was extreamly ſick, and to yeeld the King a pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at his departure, beſeeching him to leave her there to reſt, ſeeing ſhe was ill at eaſe, &amp; promiſing him that ſhe would be ready, her health recovered, to do his Majeſhy any pleaſure and ſervice it might pleaſe him to command her.

For the King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his bands, and left her to the keeping of this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who being appointed Governour of the Caſtle that night came unto my mother, and brought her one of his ſutes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, willing her ſecretly to put it on her, and to come to his chamber aſſoon as ſhe was ready: which ſhe did, and was no ſooner come, but hee commanded the Watch to let down the bridge, and open the gates, for that he minded himſelfe, onely accompanied with one Gentleman, to make the ſcout-watch, and to eſpie whether the enemy were about the Caſtle, or had ſent any ſpies to learn whether the King were there, or to know what they went about.</p>
               <p>The watch forced to obey their chief Governour, although they thought it but little policy, notwithſtanding that hee might be thought venturous, to undertake that Service which moſt private Souldiers ſeek to put by, they did as
<pb facs="tcp:165993:97"/> their Governour commanded, and let him go forth with his companion, whom they knew not.</p>
               <p>The Captain and my mother being out of the Caſtle, hee ſware there, that hee would for her ſake never enter into the ſame again, or ſerve the King his Soveraign any longer, but after he had led her home to her husband, he would ſéek his fortune in ſome ſtrange Countrey where he might be fréed from the harm that might enſue by reaſon of the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and indignation againſt him, carrying my mother away from him. Which ſhe wept marking bitterly, that ſo valiant a Captain, and worthy a Gentleman ſhould be deprived of all his wealth and ſubſtance, yea of that great honour and credit which by his virtue and proweſſe he had won among all his Country-men, both in the Court and in the Camp, for her ſake. But he moſt kindly prayed her to content her ſelf, and not to care for him; for ſo he might do her pleaſure, and ſo ſhe might by his means, injoy her content and wiſhed deſire, he ſhould be ſatisfied, ſeeing he deſired nothing ſo much as her bliſſe, and proteſting that his chiefeſt felicity conſiſted onely in her proſperity.</p>
               <p>She grieved for nothing ſo much as that ſhe wiſt not how ſhe might worthily recompence his deſerts, could not be pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but wept continually, not caring for her ſelf, but ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the good and valiant Knight had abandoned all, for to reſtore her to her former liberty, and to frée her from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>
               <p>But by this they arrived at the village, where my father was not, nor any perſon in the world in our houſe; for my father thought not that he might ſafely ſtay in his own houſe, for fear leaſt he ſhould be watched for, and by the King of <hi>Ca, ſtiles</hi> command, be ſlain by the enemy. But he had put away all his ſervants and taken me with him inſomuch that we were in a certain ſhepheards houſe ſomething far from the village which was burned, where no man durſt dwell. The Captain therefore and my mother, entring the houſe, and finding no man, marvelled greatly, and by my mothers intreaty, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:165993:97"/> thence towards the City <hi>Targonna,</hi> where ſhe made great enquiry for my father and mee, but they could not hear of us. But you muſt note by the way, that the Captain had changed his apparel and put on a ſhepheards garment, and my mother likewiſe put off her mans wéed, and attired ſelf according to her ſex. And within two or three days after they had been in city, they chanced to light on a certain ſhepheard; whom my mother knew well, and who knew my parents as well as any of all our village. Of this ſhepheard did my mother under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> returning to the caſtle where he had left her, and finding her abſent, and the general Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom he would have truſted with a greater charge, was ſo enraged, that he hanged the captain of the watch for letting him forth; and marching with his whole Army towards our village, he deſtroyed all that he met with, and put all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men that he could find to the edge of the ſword, ſparing neither man, woman, nor child. This ſhepheard told my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that foraſmuch as he had ſéen my father and me in a little cottage adjoyning to our village, he thought certainly that we had not eſcaped the Kings fury, but that wee were both ſlain: which bad tidings ſo grieved my mother, that unleſſe the good Knight had perſevered in his comfortable conſolations, ſhe had either died for ſorrow, or ended her grief by finiſhing her life with her own hands.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, my father, who by good fortune was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of the Kings furious comming to the village, eſcaped the danger, which he was like to incur; but when he heard of the proclamation which was made throughout all the country by the Kings command, &amp;c. That whoſoever could bring him the head of the ſame ſtrumpet, which refuſing to be his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, had by her diſhoneſt enticements enchanted the heart of <hi>Don Alvares de Bazora,</hi> one of his chiefeſt captains in his wars (for ſo was the good captain called) and bewitched him to love her, &amp; carry her from her husband, ſhould have all the livings that belonged or appertained to the foreſaid <hi>Don Alvares.</hi> I ſay, when my Father had heard this Proclamation, thinking
<pb facs="tcp:165993:98"/> that my mother was guilty of the crime ſhe was accuſed of, and ſuppoſing that ſhe had changed her praiſed chaſtity into wantonneſſe, he thought that ſhe had allured the Knight to lewdneſſe, which ſo grieved him that after he had largely and lamentably complained of her diſloyalty, he took me by the hand and departed out of <hi>Aragon</hi> preſently, travelling toward <hi>Italy,</hi> where in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> in a certain village called <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> he purpoſed to live the remnant of his life. In the mean time it chanced that the Kings of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> ſéeing they could not by war become Lord the one over the other, they concluded a wiſhed and durable peace among their countries, making a perpetuall league of friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid Kingdomes of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Inſomuch that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> returned to his Country with his whole army; and in ſhort ſpace were the villages and towns that had been ſacked and burned newly built up again, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the country returned home to their houſes, My mother therefore deſirous to know whether my father was ſlain nr no, returned to our village with the Knight, to inquire for my father and me, but no man could tell her any news of us. Inſomuch that ſhe verily thought that he was dead, and I likewiſe, ſhe lived in that ſtate yet three or four moneths; which time being expired, the Captain made earneſt ſute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her in reward of his ſervice and faithfulneſſe, ſeeing her husband was dead, to take him to her husband, ſwearing and proteſting that he would be as loyall unto her as any man in the world might be unto his wiſe. She acknowledging that he deſerved more then he requeſted, yet loth ſo ſoon to marry again, did drive him of as long as ſhe could, till at length not able to gainſay his lawfull requeſt, ſhe married her ſelf unto him, and to the end ſhe might forget her former deceaſed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the better thinking it but meer trouble to be cumbred with the remembrance of her dead husband being remarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe and her new husband went to ſome bordering town of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where they remained four years, having a child the firſt year named <hi>Philorenus,</hi> at my mothers requeſt, ſhe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb facs="tcp:165993:98"/> to have a new <hi>Philorenus,</hi> ſéeing ſhe had loſt the other. You muſt in like manner note, that the Captain ſith the firſt hour that he departed out of the Caſtle with my mother, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf as my father was called (to wit <hi>Coreandro</hi>) to the end that he might be unknown; which name he retained as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Thus they having long lived (as I ſaid) four years in the borders of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> certain mutinies riſing in the town of their abode, about the ſtrangers that lived in the ſame place, they left that town and went into <hi>Italy,</hi> thinking the further they went from <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the more they ſhould frée themſelves from the danger that might enſue if they ſhould be known. In this voyage my mother, either by the neceſſity of her deſtinies, or the labour of her troubleſome journey, fell ſick, and paſſed her fatal day in a certain village of <hi>Italy.</hi> Her husband the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though he ſo impatiently took the death of his dear wife, for whom he had brought himſelf into all theſe troubles, that he curſed the Fates, and blaſphemed the Gods, for ending her life and not rather his own; yet after ſhe was buried, he took his ſon and travelled on his journey, intending to paſſe over his life in ſolitary manner, admitting no occaſion of joy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, but onely ſuch as he might enjoy by the company of his young ſonne, whom nature had left him as a pledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her whom hee ſo dearly love; and it was his lucke to ſojourne in the ſame village which my father and I dwelled in, being called <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> as I have before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where this Captain with his young <hi>Philorenus,</hi> and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his alſo, remained a fortnight the one not knowing of the other.</p>
               <p>This ſpace of fourteen days being fullfilled, the King of <hi>Naples</hi> ſent two thouſand men to burn the ſame village and ſlay all the inhabitants thereof, for what reaſon I cannot now ſo well remember, and ſeeing it maketh not for my purpoſe, I will not ſtand upon it any longer, but let you know how that my father having had ſome fore-intelligence of the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as many more of our neighbours did, among whom I
<pb facs="tcp:165993:99"/> place the Captain, my mothers ſecond husband) and therefore thought beſt to flie unto ſome other place: yet the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand being ſomething haſtily put in execution it hapned that my father with all the reſt were ſo ſuddenly aſſaulted in the night time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they were compelled to leap out of their beds in their ſhirts and take their flight, leaving all they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them: ſo that neither my father had leaſure to take me with him, nor the Captain to ſave his <hi>Philorenus;</hi> yet was our luck ſuch, that though no child eſcaped untimely death, yet we the one not knowing the other, found mercy at the ſouldiers hands that were ſent to execute the Kings pleaſure. For they taking pity on us, thought it was then a ſacriledge to kill us that were ſo young, and by the diſpoſition of our bodies ſéemed likely to prove comely men. In ſo much that we were both of us priviledged from death and carried to the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> I by a certain Captain, whoſe hap it was to light on me, &amp; the other <hi>Philorenus</hi> by a Sergeant, who ſéeing his father fled, ran towards him to bath his ſword in the poor innocent child his bloud, for ſpight that his father had by flight eſcaped his fury: &amp; coming near him hearing him cry, his choller turned into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and he ſo loved the child, being about thrée years and a half old, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he having neither wife nor child, intended to carry him to <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp; bring him up as his own ſon. Thus we lived in <hi>Naples</hi> ſeven years &amp; yet had no knowledg one of the other.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall intreat you (moſt excellent Princeſſe, and ye worthy Gentlemen and ſhepheards) to mark by the way, that as we were both alike in name, ſo wee were in like manner ſo like one the other in favour, in plight of the body, in colour of hair, and in voice, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one by the judgement of the eye to diſcern the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:99"/> one of us from the other, when I had attained the eighteenth year of my age, and the other <hi>Philorenus</hi> to the fifteenth year of his age; at which time hee was fully as tall as I and in growth reached to the full proyortion of length and thickneſſe that I was of. The reaſon where of was, that we both attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our full bigneſſe at fourteene yeares of our age, in ſo much that when he reached to fourteen years, he was fully in bigneſſe equal to me.</p>
               <p>This therefore being committed to memory, you ſhall know, that after I had dwelled three years in <hi>Naples</hi> with the Captain who had brought me thither, it happened, that the ſame Captain marrying the daughter of a certain Knight of great account, celebrated the feaſt of his Wedding in very ſolemn manner. For not onely the chiefeſt Noble men of the country were invited thereto, but the King himſelf alſo, who disdained not in proper perſon to honour my Maſters Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day.</p>
               <p>The ceremonies of the marriage being finiſhed according to cuſtome, in memory of <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> there was a moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous banquet made ready for the King and thoſe Nobles that were miniſtred. And it came to paſſe, that the King caſting his eye upon me (who among other my fellows ſerved my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters gueſts at that feaſt) liked me ſo well, that he asked the Captain, whether I was of his affinity or kindred? The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaid, that I was no kin unto him, but that he eſteemed of me as of his ſon, in that a father can but give life to his ſon, as hee had done to me, ſhewing to the King where he had me, and how he brought me from the village <hi>Cinqueni.</hi> The King glad that he had ſaved ſuch a proper lad from ſo unhappy and peremptory death, prayed my maſter to reſign over the title he had to me unto him, promiſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be both for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and my welfare. To make few words, of a Captains boy, I became a Kings Page; and that day taking leave of my old maſter. I went to the Court, where I ſo ſerved the King, that I could not but pleaſe him; inſomuch that his Majeſty loved me as dearly as if I had béen ſome Noble perſonage, ſuffering
<pb facs="tcp:165993:100"/> me to want nothing, allotting me no worſe company then his own ſon, being about the ſame age that I was of, who affected me as if I had béen his natural brother. Thus I lived in this happie eſtate about two years, till Fortune remembring that ſhe had brought me to the top of her wheel, began to threatem my hapleſſe dawnfall from all felicity, into the depth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of adverſity, wiſhing me no better luck then my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had had in their time, though ſhe had at the firſt gladded me with ſuch good hap, thereby to make me the more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſuffer her croſſe, and malicious entreatments in time to come. For it is a thing moſt certain, that among all men that are oppreſſed with adverſity, none can ſo ill away with their miſhap, as they that before lived in great proſperity.</p>
               <p>But leſt I digreſſe from the matter, know that the King having had intelligence by certaine Merchants out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> muſtered his men through all his dominions, intending to make a voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to bring a mighty Army to invade the country of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the Kings of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> had refuſed to give their daughters in marriage to his ſon, fearing leſt if <hi>Spain</hi> were invaded, <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould become ſubject, and conſidering, that he had entered into league with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and divers times joyned with him againſt other Kingdomes, but loth in this expedition (ſo likely to turn to his wrack) to become a helper or confederate, purpoſed to ſend me into <hi>Perſia</hi> unto the King, to procure a peace between him and the aforeſaid Kings of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> I, though I thought my ſelf altogether unfit to be imployed in ſuch honorable kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and matters of ſuch importance, yet ſeeing it was his Majeſties pleaſure, as I thought it no manners to ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, ſo I prepared wy ſelf to put his Majeſties pleaſure in practiſe, and to provide all things neceſſary for ſuch a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Therefore knowing the Kings pleaſure. and the effect and ſum of my meſſage, I took my leave of his Majeſty and the Queen, and in like manner of his ſon <hi>Hyppolito</hi> (who was ſo ſorry for my departure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could ſcarce bid me farewel (&amp; ſo

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond day after I went from <hi>Naples,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philorenus</hi> (ſon unto my Mother by that Caſtilian Captain) dwelling in the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Sergeant that brought him from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> chanced in the evening time to paſſe by a Noble-mans houſe, where <hi>Hyppolito</hi> the Kings ſon had been at ſupper; who ſtanding at the door among certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, eſpyed this <hi>Philorenus,</hi> and thought undoubtedly that I was the man, and that I had changed my apparel to the end that I ſhould not be known to be <hi>Philorenus,</hi> which he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that I ſhould have done, being unwilling to go in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage unto the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and yet feared to ask leave to ſtay at home, and to be diſcharged of that ſo trouleſome a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I being unaccuſtomed to deal in affairs of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and importance.</p>
               <p>He therefore ſtealing from his company, followed my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for we came both out of one wombe) and when he ſaw him in place where leaſt company was, hee tooke him by the ſlip of his cloak, and calling him by his name <hi>Philorenus,</hi> bad him not be grieved though he were overtaken by him, ſeeing it was his lucke firſt to bee eſpied by him, that was the beſt friend that he had in the world. My brother knowing <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi> the Kings ſon, began to fal on his knees, to honour him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the countrey, marvelling that the young Prince uſed ſuch words unto him. But <hi>Hyppolito</hi> loth that I ſhould be knowne (for the King and all the Nobility knew not but that I was departed from <hi>Naples</hi> for <hi>Perſia</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:165993:101"/> with ſomething an angry countenance, uttered theſe words. <hi>Philorenus,</hi> if thou be wiſe follow my counſell, and leave theſe tekens of honour, leſt thou be bewrayed, and if my requeſt will not ſerve, let my commandement move thee to be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and follow me. <hi>Philorenus</hi> my brother, raviſhed with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel what this meant, and fearing to diſpleaſe him, who might make him repent his offence, did as he commanded. And ſo they went together to the court, where <hi>Hyppolito</hi> bearing my brother into his chamber, and ſhutting up the door leſt any of the Courtiers ſhould interrupt them, and know of my being there, (thinking nothing leſſe then that the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> was my Brother, ſéeing neither I my ſelf knew that I had a Brother, nor my Brother that he had a Brother in the Court, by Fortune lifted to ſo high eſtate) began in this manner to ſpeak unto him.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Philorenus,</hi> who would have thought that the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and wiſedome, whereby you have obtained ſuch love and credit at my fathers hands, had ſo loſt his force and vigor, that it ſuffereth thee ſo indiſcréetly and fondly to behave thy ſelf, being imployed by his Majeſty in a matter which might have beene committed to the chiefeſt perſon of the Realme? And art thou ſo bereſt of all thy wits and underſtanding, that thou thinkeſt we are all ſo blinde, that becauſe thou haſt put on another Garment, wee ſhould not know thee? Thinkeſt thou that we are ſo forgetfull of thy favour, that the change of apparel is able to make thée unknown unto us? No, no, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus,</hi> and although all other men were taken with oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Face, yet the Picture of thy Viſage, the Lineaments of thy Face, and the very Phiſiognomy of thy Csuntenance, is ſo déeply ingraven in my heart, that no time, no change, no alteration, no colour, nor no deceit is able to raſe out the print thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I cannot enough marvel <hi>Philorenus,</hi> that ſéeing thou knoweſt how I am affected towards thee (inſomuch that thou canſt not ask any thing of me that lieth in my power to grant thee, and be repulſed) thou haſt notwithſtanding ſo
<pb facs="tcp:165993:101"/> madly ſought ſo dangerous (if I may ſay my mind) ſo coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and baſe means to ſhake of the charge committed unto thée by the King; whereas if thou hadſt but let me know how thou wert unwilling to be imployed therein, I would have intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my father, and perſwaded him to ſend ſome other into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> that I might have enjoyed your company, for whoſe abſence I doubt not but you perceived how ſorry I was. And now, firſt you know, that though you were never more ſeen by us or known, yet you ſhould be deprived of all the credit and honor which you had in the Court, being compelled to live in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and baſe manner, wanting both wealth and fame.</p>
               <p>Beſides alſo; perpend not onely what injury you offer the King, but alſo the loſſe and detriment unto his ſubjects, and the neighbour kingdomes of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> in that my fathers intent is fruſtrated, and an embaſſage of ſuch moment, ſerving for the welfare of ſo many worthy kingdoms, neglected. The conſideration whereof, I hope will make you come to knowledge of your fondneſſe, yea rather madneſſe, in committing ſo heinous an offence and hurtful treſpaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you hade deſerved the Kings indignation, who no doubt if he were acquainted with this your franticke kind of dealing, would with no leſſe pain then death puniſh your delict,</p>
               <p>But I judge that the Gods tendring thy fortune, have made thee ſo happie, as that thou ſhouldeſt be eſpied by me before thy ſiniſter doings were bewrayed unto any other, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the King my father, to the end that I might provide ſome remedy in this caſe, and ſave thée from the danger which otherwiſe thou wert like to incur.</p>
               <p>My brother <hi>Philorenus,</hi> who all this while ſtood aſtoniſhed, not knowing the event of this matter, marvelled what fury haunted the young Prince, to make ſuch a large diſcourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; he knew not what he meant by his embaſſage, or what affair the King ſhould have committed to his charge ſéeing he had never been near the King, and was altogether unknown unto him; and therefore he knew not what he might imagine of this accident. But knowing that who ſo commeth near the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:102"/> fire is in danger to be burned, that who ſo playeth with the ſtreams may be drowned, and that they that are near Kings are ſubject to their power, began to fear leſt this ſport ſhould be turned into ſpight; and this young Prince his paſtime tend to his wrack. And therefore he fel on his knées and made <hi>Hippolito</hi> this anſwer.</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent Prince, I am a poor young man, unknown in all places of honour, and eſpecially in the Court; howbeit that I know not how your grace knoweth my name. For I confeſſe my name to be <hi>Philorenus,</hi> yet I vow and proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gods and ſacred powers of heaven, that I never lived in the Court, never wore more ſumptuous apparel then now I do; never ſpake unto his majeſty or your grace, and that I know no more of what embaſſage you ſpeak, or what charge you talk of, then I knew at the hour when I was firſt born. Wherefore I beſeech your grace to pardon me for I ſpeak the truth, as your grace well knoweth, who taketh pleaſure to mock his humble ſervant.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Philorenus</hi> replied <hi>Hippolito,</hi> haſt thou not told me thy ſelf that thou wert born about the borders betwéen the Kingdomes of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that thy father was called <hi>Coreandro,</hi> thy mother <hi>Delbia</hi> (for that was our mothers name) and that by reaſon of the wars betwéen the ſaid Kingdomes, thy father came with thee, and dwelled in the village <hi>Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> being under my fathers ſubjection, whence thou were brought to <hi>Naples?</hi> Is not this moſt true? if not, ſay I lie,</p>
               <p>God forbid (quoth my brother) that I ſhould be ſo impudent as to give your grace the lie, ſéeing that I may in more decent manner deny that which is contrary to verity then ſo. And ſéeing I confeſſe all that to be true which your grace hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified concerning my parents, my country, and my tranſlation from the place where I was born unto this country, I hope your grace will pardon me if I deny that I never told the leaſt point thereof unto you: for heaven confound me if ever I ſpake unto your grace before this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippolito</hi> moved to rage, burſt out at length into theſe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:102"/> words. Well <hi>Philorenus</hi> (quoth he) I perceive thou art more then mad, and that thou doeſt openly mock me, for I ſay that the Gods are not Gods, if they confound thee not for thy falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It were to be pardoned if thou didſt onely offnd againſt me, but ſeeing thou calleſt the Gods as witneſſes of thy hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible falſities and lies, I cannot forbear it. But I pray thee tel me one thing; haſt thou any brother living? No, (quoth my brother.) why then (qd. <hi>Hippolito</hi>) art thou the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> that my father the King had from the Captain, upon the ſame day that the ſaid Captain was married; who ſaid that he brought thee from <hi>Cinqueni.</hi> True (quoth my brother) I was brought from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> but yet I know no Captain that was married, or that gave me to the Kings Majeſty. And if it wil pleaſe your grace to go with me, or ſend to the houſe where I dwell, you ſhall both know of him that brought me from <hi>Cinqueni</hi> and all his neighbors, that I have dwelled theſe ſeven or eight years with him, even ſince the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was brought from the ſaid village <hi>Cinqueni.</hi> It is a marvellous matter (qd. <hi>Hippolito) Philorenus,</hi> that thou wilt go about to perſwade me to a tale, and to move me to believe thy lies. For if thou wert a God I durſt ſay thou lieſt. For thou haſt no brother (ſo thou doeſt confeſſe) and I take all the Gods to witneſſe that one named <hi>Philorenus</hi> born in the ſame place that thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt thy ſelf to be born in, and of the ſame parents that thou claimeſt to be thine, and of ſuch fortune as thou ſayeſt thine was. Then tell me how is it poſſible, but that thou thy ſelf muſt be the man. And albeit thou hadſt a brother, yet you ſhould not make me believe that he can be ſo like thee, as that I ſhould be ſo abſurdly deceived. Therefore ſéeing thou art ſo obſtinate, thou ſhalt try what thou art able to gain therewith.</p>
               <p>Herewith <hi>Hypolito</hi> taketh him by the hand and leadeth him unto the chamber of preſence, where all the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen began to cheriſh and welcome him, asking the cauſe of his ſudden return and why he had ſo diſguiſed himſelf in apparel.</p>
               <p>My brother almoſt out of his wits wiſt not what to think,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:103"/> but that either they were all more then fooliſh, or he born to be ſcoffed and mocked at: yea he could not a great while be perſwaded but that he dreamed. But <hi>Hyppolito</hi> looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſéeing what countenance he bore, burſt out into theſe words, all the Courtiers ſtanding aboot O moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning counterfeit who ever ſaw the like? No doubt <hi>Philore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> doth not or rather will not remember, that ever he knew any of all this noble company of Gentlemen and Ladies, whereas notwithſtanding, they all diſdain not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yea and claim old acquaintance. As he had ſo ſaid, the King came into the chamber of preſence to ſée what the matter was, (for he had already heard ſomething touching my comming as they thought) and ſéeing my brother, welcommed him after this manner, Ha our Embaſſadour, you have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had wings to flie, or you have as much ſéen <hi>Perſia</hi> as I have ſeen <hi>Jove;</hi> but I pray you tell mee what may bee the cauſe of this your holi-day-coat? Have you met with fooles by the way? or are you a weary of a Courtiers life? if the one, I was well addreſſed to ſend ſuch a Legate to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and if the other, I will ſoon relieve thée from that care.</p>
               <p>With that the King being angry at the heart, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſon <hi>Hyppolito</hi> to take order that he might be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon till hee had deliberated what death hee ſhould die. Which thing when diſtreſſed <hi>Philorenus</hi> heard, he fell on his knées and began thus to intreat his Majeſty to be mercifull unto him. Moſt excellent Monarch, I beſéech your Majeſty by the religion &amp; duty that all mortall men owe to the divine powers, to hear me clear my felf of all ſuch crimes which it ſhould ſéem that I have committed againſt your majeſty. For I perceive that either it pleaſeth your Majeſty to exhilirate &amp; glad your Courtiers with my miſery, and threaten me impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and death to give them occaſion to laugh at my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe and innocencie, or there hath been ſome other man of my name and like me, that hath committed this heinous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt your Majeſty, which moſt falſly is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. For I proteſt before heaven and earth that, I am not
<pb facs="tcp:165993:103"/> that <hi>Philorenus</hi> (if ſuch an one hath béen here) as I will prove by the ſouldier that brought me from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> with whom I have dwelled ever ſince I was by him brought to <hi>Naples;</hi> as he and all his neighbors ſhall teſtifie, or Ile die what death your Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to appoint.</p>
               <p>The King hearing him ſo ſoberly proteſt and ſwear that he was not the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> they took him to be, commanded him to tell one of his guard where the ſame ſouldier dwelt, which when my brother had done, the King commanded the ſame man whom my brother ſaid was his maſter, and four or five of his chiefeſt neighbors, ſhould the next day come before him.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the ſame Sergeant being called <hi>Signori Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentino,</hi> accompanied with three or four Gentlemen of great credit dwelling in the ſame Pariſh, with him were brought, appeared before his Majeſty according to his command and my brother being brought before them, the King asked them whether they knew that fellow?</p>
               <p>They all anſwered yes, and told the King all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances concerning my brothers Parents, and his comming from <hi>Cinquent</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> affirming all what they had ſaid, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their oaths.</p>
               <p>The King marvelled that all things agréed with the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus</hi> for whom he took him to be, both his name, the place where he was born, the name of his parents; and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents onely this different, that he had dwelt with a Captain which gave him to the King, where theſe men teſtified that that <hi>Philorenus</hi> whom they had preſent, had dwelt with the Sergeant till that preſent day, and never entred into the Court; inſomuch that the K. began to think that there were two brothers of them, and that they themſelves knew it not, by reaſon that they were ſeparated one from the other ſo timely. But to the end that he might be the ſurer of this matter, he ſent for the Captain of whom he had me. Who being come, and having ſéen my brother; the King asked him whether he knew any privy token about my body whereby he might know
<pb facs="tcp:165993:104"/> me, if there were one in the world ſo like me that he might hardly be known from me. Such token (anſwered the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) I know none, my Soveraign Lord; neither is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for I nor any man that hath eys can doubt of this man, but that it is <hi>Philorenus</hi> whom I brought from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> and I will not onely ſay ſo, but alſo affirm it by oath, and die up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame. The other Gentlemen that were preſent ſaid that he might be deceived, for that they had already depoſed the contrary.</p>
               <p>To make few words if the King had not been preſent, they had gone together by the ears, and tried the matter not by words but by wounds rather, and by fight come to knowledge of the right <hi>Philorenus,</hi> but the King commanded them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their manſion place, and to leave the perſon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom the queſtion grew, (to wit my brother) with him, for that he would not be ſatisfied, but would have him kept in hold till ſuch time as he might ſend into <hi>Perſia</hi> after me to know whether I were there or no: imagining that if I were found there, then the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> that they had in the Court ſhould be my brother; and if it were ſo, the King inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give him ſome high office; but if contrarily I were not found in <hi>Perſia,</hi> then it ſhould be manifeſt that the ſame <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus</hi> was no other but the man who he was judged by all the courtiers to be, and both he and his pretended maſter, with the other Gentlemen that were before the King, ſhould with death be puniſhed for their madneſſe, in taking upon them to depoſe ſuch falſities, and ſo openly to mock with their King and Soveraign.</p>
               <p>Well, they being returned, and my brother clapt in hold, two Knights were diſpatched from the court to <hi>Perſia,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their journey th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had travelled two days from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> as I rode with my men through a huge wood, we met with five and twenty <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> who having certain Cells in that Wood, lived upon the ſpoil of thoſe that paſſed through the ſame. Theſe Villains, ugly in countenance, in colour reſembling Divels, and in ſtature Gyants, having eſpied us, and ſeeing that we were able to out-run them being on horſeback, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on before us, as if they had not thought of us till they had reached to a place ſerving fit for their purpoſe, where our horſe hindred us more then they could advantage our valour. For we entred into a Thicket ful of Thorns and Brambles, where we were compelled to alight, and lead our horſes by the bridle, and had more trouble to pull them after us, then to paſs our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> therefore thinking it time to purſue their prey, came all of them towards us, and being moſt of them armed with demi-pikes and javelins, ſet upon us ſo fiercely on the ſudden, that we ſcarce knew whether were the beſt, to reſiſt their fury, or yeeld to their mercy. But ſéeing we had no time to deliberate upon the matter, quick expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neceſſary, and I perpending that all the mercy that ſuch villains had was more then cruelty, I thought it better to die in the defence of our honour, then to fall into the hands of ſuch barbarous raſcals.</p>
               <p>Then I drew my ſword, as alſo all the reſt did that were with me, and abandoning our horſes, we dealt with the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains in ſuch ſort, that we woundes thrée or four of them dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:105"/> but yet we could not eſcape their hands, by reaſon that they were ſo many of them, and had the vantage of us, in that they had half-pikes, and we had none. To be ſhort, the end of the conflict was ſuch that I could more deplore it then avoid it; for the moſt of my men were ſlain, the reſt eſcaped by flight, and I being thruſt through the arm with a pike, was taken by the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> villains, and bound hand and foot, and ſo htey caſt me upon one of our horſes, and brought me to their cels; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they alſo conveyed the horſes and my baggage. When I was brought to their cell, they began to conſult what they ſhould do with me. For they thought it pity (which affection did not proceed from any good diſpoſition in them, ſeeing they were bereft of all good qualities, but rather was bred in them by the wil and pleaſure of the Gods, who being moved to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would deliver me from the wicked villains) to kill me, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had gotten ſo great a booty by me; and on the other ſide, they feared that if I ſhould eſcape, their knavery ſhould be detected, by reaſon that I did not onely know their wicked kind of dealings, but alſo the place where they kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, being the moſt ſecret place in the world. But after they had a long time deliberated upon the matter, they came by me and brought me ſuch meat as they had (though I had no great luſt to eat) and untied the cords wherewith they had bound me, but they put on a pair of ſhackles on my legges, for fear I ſhould out-run them. Thus I lived among them the ſpace of nine or ten moneths in ſuch miſery, that I wiſhed death every day to deliver me from the wretched life which I led in that pittiful kind of captivity,</p>
               <p>But I will return to my brother, whoſe hap was evil by reaſon of my miſhap. For the knights that were ſent into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> to enquire for me, returned to <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp; informed the King, that they had not heard any thing of me, and that they could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Majeſty, that I had not béen ſéen in <hi>Perſia,</hi> nor in any place between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſave onely in one town about one days journey from the Court, in which place they had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intelligence that I had béen ſeen. Other information they
<pb facs="tcp:165993:105"/> had none. The Sergeant my brothers maſter, and the other Gentlemen his neighbours upon this news, fled, fearing leſt they ſhould have been unjuſtly put to death, blaming Fortune for that ſhe dealt ſo cruelly with them, that they were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by flight to ſave their lives when they had not in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſerved death. But the King being informed of their flight, cauſed all their lands and livings to be confiſcatcd, and adjudged to his exchequer, and my brother <hi>Philorenus</hi> was the ſame day arraigned and condemned to be torn in pieces with four horſes. But it chanced on that day which was appointed for his execution, that the Queen fell in labor, and was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a daughter to celebrate the feaſt of whoſe birth, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers execution was prolonged thirty days; for the King would not have any ſuch act comitted all the time the Queen lay in child-bed. In the mean time (moſt gracious Princeſſe) may you think in what taking my poor brother might be, that wiſt not how he might eſcape that cruel death which he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, although his conſcience cleared him of all offence or crime, whereby he might deſerve any puniſhment.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, Fortune minding either to alleviate his grief, or to bring him into greater troubles, ſuborned a certain knights daughter which attended on the Queen, to ſnatch occaſion at the delay which ſhe heard the King had comanded to be made concerning the putting of my brothex to death; and to ſeek means to deliver him out of priſon, and thereby to ſave his life, For this Gentlewoman being called <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> (whom I loved better then my ſelf) thinking, with the King and all the reſt of the courtiers, that my brother was the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> that courted her, and ſo earneſtly made love unto her, that ſhe might eaſtly perceive that he loved and honored her above all other women; when ſhe heard that <hi>Philorenus</hi> was condemned, ſhe was exceeding ſorry. But the good chance of the Queens child-bearing, by reaſon whereof the time of his death was prolonged, ſomething aſſwaged her dolour, and gave her hope, that ſhe might find meanes to recompence the ſervice which ſhe ſupoſed he had done her.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:106"/>
               <p>Therefore upon the third day after the young Princeſſe was born, conſidering that all the Courtiers were merry, and took more care how they might paſſe over the time with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good chear, and recreating themſelves with divers ſorts of paſtimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they did in looking who were preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or who went in or out of the chamber of preſence; ſhe ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the Queens privie chamber to her chamber, and there araying her ſelf in mans apparel; (for ſhe had a ſute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her brother, which he had left in her chamber) and taking her apparel under her cloak, ſhe hieth to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that kept my brother, and finding him buſie with playing at tables, asked him how it fared with <hi>Philorenus?</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thinking that ſhe had been Miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſillaes</hi> brother (for he knew the cloaths, and her brother being but a young youth without any hair on his face, ſhe was not misdoubted to be any other then he himſelf) told her that <hi>Philorenus</hi> would perhaps be as merry as the reſt, if he knew not the day of his death, which though it were prelonged, yet it abated not his grief. I pray you (quoth the transformed Gentleman) may not a man talk with him? Why not (quoth the Gentleman?)

               <p>
                  <hi>Philorenus,</hi> albeit you perhaps are of opinion that I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſpiſe the courteſies which you have offered me at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, as I ſeemed to make light of them in word, and that I rewarded thy ſervice with inward hate, as I feigned by outward frowardneſſe, yet I hope thou ſhalt in time by trial prove this ſurmiſe falſe, and be forced to confeſſe that ſhe is not ungratefull whom thou ſo often haſt accuſed to be cruel. For though I did repay thee with a frown whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wiſhed thée a favour, and yeelded thee a lowring countenance when I wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thee a pleaſing ſmile, to make proof of thy conſtancy: I
<pb facs="tcp:165993:106"/> doubt not, but now ſéeing I make thee acquainted with the cauſe, thou wilt not take the effect in ill part.</p>
               <p>My brother, admiring at the ſtrangeneſſe of this ſpeech, wiſt not what to anſwer. For he knew not the perſon that ſpake unto him, and was in doubt whether it was a man or a woman, her apparel ſhewing the one, and the courſe of her talk the other: and therefore he thought beſt not to interrupt her diſcourſe, but to hear the end of her tale, which ſhe continued on in this manner,</p>
               <p>And conſidering (ſwéet <hi>Philorenus</hi>) that the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that may be done unto any man is to ſave him from the terribleneſſe of untimely death, I am reſolved to ſhew thée no leſſe gratuity and recompence for thy faithfull and loyall ſervice, then to frée thée from the Kings rage, or my ſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the ſame danger that you be in your ſelf. Vnto which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have my ſelf put on my brothers cloathes, and brought mine under my cloak to attire you therewith, and ſo lead you out of this chamber where you are impriſoned, and rid you from the danger which you know that you now are in.</p>
               <p>And for as much as delay bréedeth danger, I pray you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch and follow my counſell, for the Courtiers are all ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with wine, that we may paſſe and repaſſe without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>
               <p>My brother was ſo perplexed, being ſurpriſed with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and grief together, that he could ſcarce tell what he ſhould do; for though he ſuſpected that this Gentlewoman miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him as the King and the other courtiers did yet he feared leaſt ſhe had been ſuborned by the King to brin,g him into a fools paradice, and ſo to agravate his miſery. Wherefore as he ſtood amazed doubting what were beſt for him to do, ſhe urged him in this manner to make ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Loving <hi>Philorenus</hi> doeſt thou now make ſo ſtrange of her, that to ſave thy life putteth her own in hazard? Haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten whaf pleaſure thou wert wont to ſay I did thée in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thée leave to ſpeak to me, and art thou ſo chary now of thy tongue that thou wilt not utter one word? Thou haſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb facs="tcp:165993:107"/> ſworn that thou wouldeſt not ſpare thy life to do me ſervice; and now I venture mine to do thée pleaſure, wilt thou not accept of my ſervice?</p>
               <p>My brother conſidering that the worſt that might enſue was death framed her this anſwer.</p>
               <p>Sweet Lady, if I have diſpleaſed you with ungratefull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, perſwade your ſelf that the onely cauſe thereof did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed of the joy which I conceived of your preſence, whereby I was wrapped in an extaſie; inſomuch that my tongue and my other inſtruments of ſpéech, as I thought to have welcomed you, denied me their accuſtomed duty, having loſt their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by reaſon of the exceſſe of gladneſſe which poſſeſſed my ſoul. But I beſéech you go not about to undo your ſelf to ſave me, leaſt in ſeeking my weal you procure your own woe, &amp; ſo where but one ſhould ſuffer death you bring both in danger.</p>
               <p>Miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> glad of his anſwer, but ſorry to ſee him make no more haſt, to do that which ſhe deſired, ſhe ſpurred him forward ſaying.</p>
               <p>Sweet <hi>Philorenus</hi> doubt not but I am perſwaded of thy love towards me, and that I think of thy ſilence as thou ſayeſt. As for the reſt, let me alone I hope where you fear we ſhall both fall in the trap, that we ſhall neither of us be ſnared in the net, and therefore be ruled by me, ſeeing womens wits have ſometimes brought that to paſſe which mens minds hath admired.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, my brother became miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> in attire, and was apparelled in her cloaths, whoſe body was the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of my heart, accompanied by the Saint whom I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped though abſent, and in whom my mind dwelled, though my body was in ſubjection to the villaines that kept me in their cels after they had robbed me and ſlain my men. Yet if I had then known of the love and affection of my miſtreſſe towards me, and how willingly ſhe would have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver me from the barbarous entertainment of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian theeves, if ſhe had known that her faithfull <hi>Philore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was ſo afflicted; my miſery (though it had been greater)
<pb facs="tcp:165993:107"/> could not have béen half ſo troubleſome unto me, nor my filthy priſon ſo noiſome. But leaſt I be troubleſome unto this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy company by digreſſing from the matter, know that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſed for miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> and ſhe for her brother, and bidding the Gentleman that was charged with him <hi>Adieu,</hi> they departed leaving him ſo buſie at his game, that he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his play more then his priſoner. Inſomuch that they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the haſte they could, marched through the Court, and reſembling that they went to walk in the fields, they ſpared not their legs, but ſometimes running, ſometimes going a round pace, they did advantage their journey in ſuch manner, that the next morning (having travelled all night) they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wood where <hi>I</hi> was, there thinking themſelves out of danger, they reſted.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow though they had made ſufficient proviſion of money, yet when hunger began to gnaw them, having diſgeſted their meat by their walk or rather flight, they wiſt not what ſhift to make for victuals. Inſomuch that they went ſtraying up and down the wood to ſee if they could find any roots or wild fruit growing there, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feed on them, till finding the way to ſome houſe they might buy other kind of meat. But miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> being weary of raunging and overtaken with ſleep, lay down amidſt the buſhes, and prayed my brother alſo to reſt himſelf a while: but he having more mind to eat then to ſleep, bid her take her reſt and he would in the mean time ſeek for ſome victuals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſhe waked. Inſomuch that he marked the place where he left her, and went towards the ſide of the wood whence he might ſee a chimney ſmoaking. Whereof glad, though he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:165993:108"/> loſt he ſhould be mett with, hee ventured and went to the houſe, where he found a poor old woman ſitting by the fire all alone, and deſired her of all friendſhip, to let him have bread for his mony. The woman perceiving that he was ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of account (in mean time may it pleaſe you to note that my brother and miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> had changed apparel in the way. each taking that ſute which agreed to their ſexe) told him that ſhe had bread, but ſhe feared it was too brown for his eating but he deſiring her to let him have it ſuch as it was, ſhe brought him four loaves, which he took, and paying her as much as ſhe asked, to the wood he returned as faſt as he could: where he had eſpied a fountain, and therefore ſtayed not with the old woman to drink, ſhe proffering him a glaſſe of <hi>Cydar,</hi> being a kind of wine made of apples. For he purpoſed to carry miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> bread firſt, and then to lead her to the ſaid fountain, and there with her to quench his thirſt. But when he came to the place where he left her, miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> was not there; for waking out of her ſleep, ſhe went to ſee if ſhe could méet with him; for becauſe he had been ſomething long away (ſéeing the place whither he went for bread, was about one league from the wood, and he had wandred up and down the wood about two or three hours, ere he came to the wood ſide whence he eſpied the ſmoak) ſhe ſuſpected that he was loſt in the wood, and could not find the way to come unto her again. And ſo it came to paſſe, that ſhe ſeeking him loſt him, and he not finding her, loſt himſelf. For he was ſo diſtracted with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and grief, that as a man abandoning all hope, &amp; in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpairing, he ſate down, and laying his elbow on the ground to ſupport his head, began in this manner to exclaim againſt Fortune for her ſpighfull entreatment,</p>
               <p>Ah Fortune, I perceive my deſtinies have ordained me to be the ſubject whereon thou mayeſt work thy power, and ſhew thy inconſtancy: and whereon thou doſt plant the banner of thy forces, and hang up the trophees of thy victories: For who is there that is acquainted with the courſe of my life, that dare deny, but that every part thereof hath bin guided by Fortune,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:108"/> and ſubject to her accidentary government? For after the day of my birth (the circumſtance whereof may be attributed to no power but to the hidden ſecrets of dame Nature onely) was it not a chance and accidental cauſe. that I ſhould with my cradle by my parents be carried out of my country, and live in exile, before I knew what exile, yea what life was? was it not (ſay I) a token of the ſparkles of anger which began to gliſter in the heart of Fortune, and a manifeſt ſign that ſhe began to menace and threaten me ſome diſaſtrous hap in time to come? For I lived not many weeks after, but I ſaw the fire flame, which was kindled of the former ſparkles, and I tried the force of her menaces- For before we could reach to any place where we might ſojourn, death bereft me of my dear mother, before nature allowed me to acknowledg the benefit which by her I had and did receive.</p>
               <p>This done, Fortune ſeemed not not to have wreaked her anger ſufficiently, and as yet became nothing more méek; for after my mother was buried, and her funeral rights celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we came to the village <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> where I was deprived of my father, all the hold of my hope, and the pillar of my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Now Fortune thought her ſelfe prettily well reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on me that had never offered her any wrong, and began to turn her frowns into ſmiles, and her anger into favour. For who can deny, but that it was an eſpecial good turn of Fortune to ſnatch men out of the cruel claws of griping death, whereas none other might eſcape the rage and fury of the maſſacring ſouldiers that were ſent to overthrow the ſaid village, being the place of our habitation? Vnleſſe it be ſo that I had ſome brother, who (though I knew him not) received the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at Fortunes hands that I had, to the end that after wee had been ſhrined up by Fortune, I in the houſe of the good Sergeant, and he in the court, we ſhould both of us fall into the gulph of extream miſery, and that being led into adverſity, we ſhould féel the effect of Fortunes anger, which for a time ſhe diſſembled, feigning to favour us, where ſhe procured means to wrong us.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:109"/>
               <p>But among other calamities, what can be more grievous unto me, then to be ſo ſeparated from my brother (if I may by Natures conſent claim any ſuch title) that I never ſhould have ſéen him yet, nor be like to ſee him hereafter? Neither is it a leſſe torment for me, that by him I ſhould be brought into theſe miſeries, and that he ſhould be cauſe of all my miſhap, who no doubt, if he knew it, would if he could redreſſe my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. But ſéeing he is not in <hi>Perſia,</hi> aſſuredly ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif hath befallen him, wherewith Fortune hath purpoſed to work both our deſtructions. The Gods grant that I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie falſly, though the apparent ſhew of all things force me to divine the contrary. And laſtly, this latter pinch of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſpight, in that ſhe is abſent who is the cauſe that I am preſent, (yea, ſimpliciter that I am, for without her I had now not béen at all) in rancour doth ſurpaſs all the malice that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhe hath ever endeavoured, laboured, or enterpriſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Ah ſwéet <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> courteous <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> yea moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> how wilt thou blame and accuſe me of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ingratefulneſs if thou ſuſpect that I have pupoſely left thée of free will and counſel, and voluntarily abandoned thee? But I hope thou wilt not hold ſuch opinion of me but rather impute this hapleſs chance to Fortune, who hath ſworn to make me miſerable.</p>
               <p>And alas whither ſhall I go, or what way ſhall I take? ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſweet guide is taken from me in whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my coming is not from impriſonment to liberty, or thral, dom to freedom, or from death to life; but rather from one kind of captivity, bondage &amp; death, into an other; altering the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my miſery, not abating the extremity of my calamity.</p>
               <p>Therewith my brother <hi>Philorenus,</hi> not able ſpeak to any longer for the multitude of ſighs which he fetched from his heart, and tears which ſpouted out of his eys, he wept moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, in which plight I will leave him a while, and declare unto you what Fortune mtſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſiila</hi> had: who having ſtrayed up and down the wood a long time, and calling for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus</hi> as loud as ſhe could, weeping &amp; lamenting his abſence
<pb facs="tcp:165993:109"/> in moſt grievous manner, at length ſhe eſpied the cel where I was penned up by the villains, who had that morning ſhifted me, and taking my apparel with them to ſell it, gave me an old garment of theirs to cover my body withal; and ſo leaving no man but me in the cell, barred the door on the out ſide and went their way: and <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> having eyed the cell, hoping to find <hi>Philorenus</hi> my brother there (for ſhe had forgotten her hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) made haſt to draw near, &amp; knocking at the door ſhe heard her firſt <hi>Philorenus</hi> ſpeak, for whoſe cauſe ſhe made ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the other being my brother. For when I heard one knock, I asked who was there? whereupon ſhe anſwered. Ah ſwéet <hi>Philorenus!</hi> (thinking that I was the other whom ſhe had loſt, for our voices were not more different then our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) what art thou there? I muſt confeſſe my ſelf beholding to Fortune for this good hap; but why doſt thou not let me in? I having forgotten her voice, it being altered by reaſon of the affection wherewith in a lamentable manner ſhe pronounced her words, replied. Whatſoever you be whom fortune hath ſent to comfort me after my long impriſonment, if you wil ſée me, then muſt you from the out-ſide undo the door, and remove ſuch bars or ſtops that hinder or let you from entring ſéeing I am ſhut in, and cannot come forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> marvelling at my ſpéech, with a knife ſhe cut the ſtring wherewith the cell door was faſtened, and opening the door, asked me where I was? inſomuch that I looking by the light that came in at the door (for it was dark within) I ſaw Miſtreſſe <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> ſtand before the cell, the ſight of whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence caſt me into ſuch a trance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might have béen thought I had béen metamorphoſed, as they that looking on <hi>Meduſaes</hi> head were transformed into ſtones. But when <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> ſaw that I neither came, nor gave her any anſwer, ſhe ſtepped into the cell, where ſhe ſaw me lye on the ground, not onely tongue-tyed without ſpeaking, but alſo leg-tied, being bound with a ſtrong cord. Which ſight, although it was ſufficient to make her loſe her wits, &amp; become as much altered as I was my ſelf: yet the neceſſity wherein I was requiring aid, moved her to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb facs="tcp:165993:110"/> her own paſſions and to ad her helping hand to wake me out of the extaſie wherein I lay. At length being come to my ſelf, I ſaid. Ah what fortune hath ſent thée to this ſolitary wood to deliver me from this miſery? Whoſe preſence is more welcome to me, then if ſome heavenly Godeſs had come to loſe the bands which your moſt delicate fingers have untwined. and therewith twiſted the knot of the true and ſincere love, wherewith I moſt loyally honoured thée for the time that I lived in the Court. Ah <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> had I known that thou hadſt béen ſo mindfull of my ſervice, and that thou didſt accept of the pains or rather pangs which I ſuffered for love of thee, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity which I have béen peſtred with in this noiſom priſon, for the ſpace of theſe ten moneths or more, had not been ſo grievous unto me as it hath been. For the ſweet thought and pleaſant conceit which my brains hath béen occupied with, in perpending and remembring your excellent beauty and rare vertues, hath taken more force in the pareke of my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo combred my mind with the delightſome memory of your perſonage, that it had quite blotted out all thought of the injury which I have received at fortunes hands, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all ſuch grief from my heart which I did take for the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and lamentable entertainment which I have had in this loathſome cell. Where ever ſince the ſecond day that I departed from the Court for I have béen compelled to abide, being fallen into the hands of certain Egyptian théeves, who haunting theſe woods, violently ſet upon me and my men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either all ſlain, or ſome fled, robbed me of all my treaſure and baggage that I had with me, and either pittying to kill me outright, or rather ſuppoſing they ſhould uſe me too curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly if they ended my miſery with death, they have kept me here in this cell in ſuch manner as you find me; leaving me here this morning, and going to ſome town or other to ſell the apparel which I had, ſeeing the money which they found in my male was much diminiſhed, and their ſtore greatly impaired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> raviſhed into admiration by the ſtrangeneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:165993:110"/> this accident, was doubtfull at the firſt of me, thinking that I had been the ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> that came with her from the Court, and whoſe life ſhe had ſaved by her policy: but wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending my words, and applying them to the things both paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and preſent; ſhe remembred that the Knights who were ſent into <hi>Perſia</hi> ſaid, that they had heard that I had been ſeen in a certaine towne within two dayes after I departed from <hi>Naples,</hi> and beſides, ſhe did ſee that I had on other cloaths then the man whom ſhe left in the woods, which forced her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me, and to know how ſhe had been deceived in taking another man inſtead of me.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not here make mention of ſuch congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations and cheriſhments as ſhe made me; leaving it unto your diſcretions to judge how joyfull men be at ſuch happy meetings. In the mean time, it may pleaſe you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> told me all that had happened in the Court concerning the other <hi>Philorenus,</hi> how he had not only my name, but my favour and my fortune, being born where I was born, exiled where I was in exile, and had the ſame parents that I had for mine; how that he was in the Court taken of all men for me, how that the Knights were ſent into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and bringing news that I had not been there, he was condemned to be torn in pieces by four wild horſes. And finally, how ſhe had delivered him from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, and loſt him in the wood, ſuppoſing that it had been he when ſhe heard me ſpeak. Whereat I did the more marvell, by reaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I never heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I had any brother. But after wee had parleyed of all things, fearing leſt we ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:165993:111"/> taken together by the villains before we were out of ſight of that accurſed cell, we went into the wood as deep as we could; partly to eſcape them, and partly to find <hi>Philorenus</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as <hi>Ceraſilla</hi> could not be altogether merry for the hard luck that he was loſt, ſo was I excéeding ſorry, by reaſon that I ſo gréedily deſired to ſee him; to know whether he were my brother indeed or no. And as we had for the ſpace of one whole day and night ranged up and down the ſame huge wood, at length we purpoſed to return to the Court, and to certifie the King of all matters, informing his Majeſty of the right truth. Hoping that his Majeſty would not onely pardon <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> who was forced by love to do whatſoever ſhe had practiſed in going away with <hi>Philorenus</hi> my brother; but alſo by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recal him again, and the Gentlemen in like manner, that were fled to ſhun his unjuſt wrath and anger, reſtoring them their goods and livings that were confiſcated. As in truth his majeſty did. For when we were returned to the Court, not without great admiration of the King &amp; <hi>Hyppolito</hi> the young Prince, with all the reſt of thoſe that were in the Court, and knéeling before his Majeſty, had declared the whole eſtate of all ſuch accidents and events as had hapned, he did not onely pardon <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> but deſcending from his chair of eſtate em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me and ſo curteouſly welcommed me, that I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his Majeſty was no otherwiſe affected towards me, then he was at my departure from the Court.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he reſted not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the ſame day recalled the Gentlemen that had teſtified how my brother had dwelled with the Sergeant, and not onely reſtored them their goods and lands, but alſo beſtowed no ſmall gift on the ſaid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant my brothers maſter; taking order beſides, that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould alſo be recalled, promiſing that as ſoon as he were returned to the Court, he would Knight both him and my ſelf: in memorial of that ſo rare an example of two brothers, that were ſo like one the other, the one nevertheleſſe not knowing of the other.</p>
               <p>But I to revenge the injury done unto me by thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
<pb facs="tcp:165993:111"/> théeves, and to puniſh them according as they for the cauſe of their abhominable and wicked life merited, I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave of the King to take one of the companies that lay in garriſon in <hi>Naples,</hi> for the cuſtody and ſafeguard both of the City and Court; therewith to march to the Cel where thoſe villains had kept me ſo long: and coming thither we had ſuch good luck, that we took them all ſaving one being but newly returned to the cell the night before. But miſſing one of them I commanded two or three ſouldiers to go into the cell, to ſee whether they could find no more there. They finding none but one being bound in ſuch manner as they had uſed me, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that it was ſome poor man that the villains had caught (for they could not ſee what he was in the cell) brought him forth unto me, whom I and all the company that was with me preſently knew to be the other <hi>Philorenus</hi> my ſuppoſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which thing ſo filled my heart with joy, that I imbraced him before he was unloſed. He not knowing who I was at the firſt marvelled, but after he had heard me declare unto him how I had found <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſhewed him favour, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame <hi>Philorenus</hi> whom he was thought to be, &amp; beholding me, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth burſt out into theſe or ſuch like words.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſéeing I neither dream, nor behold my proportion in a looking glaſſe I confeſs that both the King had great cauſe to bear an opinion of me as he did, and theſe villains to uſe me as they intended; who meeting me in the wood as I had loſt miſtreſs <hi>Ceraſilla,</hi> thinking I had béen the man they robbed &amp; kept in their cel, &amp; becauſe I denied I knew either the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or their cel, they appointed to kil me aſſoon as their fellow was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereby I perceived that you had béen in their hands, and had got from them, ſeeing they could as little be perſwaded that they had never ſeen me, as the King &amp; all his courtiers; for in truth I my ſelf, if I had not known as much as by fortunes frowardneſs I have tried, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſimilitude &amp; likeneſs between your perſon and my ſelf. I would now have thought, that you had béen of the nature of the glaſſe that receiveth the colour of every object body: whereas you ſay that the Gods
<pb facs="tcp:165993:112"/> ſtrive againſt fortune to free us from her frowardneſſe, I am conſtrained to ſay no leſſe, ſeeing that it hath pleaſed their Deity by him to loſe me from this danger of death, by reaſon of whom (though not by his procurement) all my troubles and miſeries took beginning. Wherefore ſeeing that our luck is ſuch that as the evil ſucceſſe of your fortune was cauſe of my miſery, ſo the recovery of your hap hath bred my bliſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me frem the extream perill wherein my life was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. What may I ſay leſſe, but that the Gods knowing how we have by fortune been wronged, have reſcued us from her fury.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it would be too long for me to rehearſe, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for you to hear the end of his ſpeech, and the other talk which we had between us, concerning ſuch matters as had happened by reaſon of our great likeneſſe, <hi>I</hi> will onely tel you, that after we had had ſome conference touching our parents and other matters, we cauſed thoſe Egyptian villains to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the horſe tails, and ſo trailed along the ground till we came to <hi>Naples,</hi> where the hangman ſaved his labour, ſeeing that no perſon thought he had done his duty unleſſe he had hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to pull and tear the fleſh of ſome part of thoſe Egyptian wretches, that had cauſed ſuch confuſion, and wrought ſo much harm, had not the foreſight of the mercifull Gods hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their intent. Inſomuch that within two hours after theſe Egyptian ſlaves had entered the gates of the City, they were by the people halled and pulled into a thouſand pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will not here make long rehearſall, how honourably my brother was uſed by the King, but it ſhall be ſufficient if <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how that the King after he had welcommed my brother in all courteous manner with a pleaſant countenance, as wel bewraying grace and mildneſſe, as Majeſty and glory, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his promiſe made unto me in word, did perform no leſſe indeed, and Knighted us both together the ſame day.</p>
               <p>Now (moſt excellent Princes and worthy ſhepheards) did we think that we had ſo troden fortune under foot, that ſhe was not able ever to riſe again, or impair us any more. Now
<pb facs="tcp:165993:112"/> lived we as two brothers in all kind of proſperity, and ſo high hoiſed to the top of bliſſe, that we little thought that any power had béen able to caſt us down and deprive us of our preſent felicity. But alack we found the contrary by triall, and were compelled to acknowledge our error by experience. Better had it béen for us with the carefull and waxy Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to conſider that an extraordinary calm, is token of ſome future tempeſt to come on the ſudden: for then as he at ſuch times ſtriketh his ſails, and ſhunning the dangerous ſeas, commendeth his bark to the ſecure haven; ſo we foreſéeing the danger unto which we were ſubject in our great proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might have eſcaped the events which brought our adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſéeing things paſt may be deplored not recalled, and repented, not amended; I muſt needs ſay that we bought <hi>had I wiſt,</hi> at a dear price: as you ſhall underſtand by the ſequell of this hiſtory. But ſeeing I have not yet mentioned any thing concerning my father, and the Captain my brothers father, ſince that they fled from <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When <hi>Cinqueni</hi> the place whence we were brought to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> was by the ſouldiers ſent by the King to execute his wrath on the inhabitants thereof, pilled and ſpoiled, <hi>Coreandro</hi> my father thinking that I was dead (for he had heard that none in all the village were left alive, neither men, wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and he did not know that I was ſaved by a Captain and led unto <hi>Naples</hi>) thought to return home again to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and there live among his friends, ſeeing hee had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort in the world, being by fortunes peſtilent hatred, bereft not of goods onely, but of wife and child alſo. Inſomuch that he having reſolved to return home to the place of his
<pb facs="tcp:165993:113"/> birth took his way from the ſaid village along the coaſts of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> towards <hi>Aragon,</hi> where after he had marched one day, the next morning riſing betimes, to take the advantage of cool <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi> before <hi>Phoebhs</hi> rayes compelled the travellers to ſeek for ſhadow amidſt their journey, he paſſed through a little ſhort wood where he heard the other <hi>Coreandro,</hi> the good captain my brothers father, lament and bewail his hard fortune, in this manner.</p>
               <p>Ah Fortune, men paint thée ſtanding upon a Globe, as thereby decyphering thy inconſtancy: which their opinion made me always deceive my ſelf with vain hope, truſting that thou wouldeſt once turn thy frowardneſſe into lovingneſs and thy frowns into favors. But I perceive thou haſt made choice of me by experience of mine own miſeries and adverſity, to oppoſe my ſelf againſt al men in thy defence, ſéeing that where as they all generally hold opinion, that thou art the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of inconſtancy and mutability, each one particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming upon thee, and blaming thee for thy fléeting unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe; I in contrary manner am forced and compelled to affirm againſt them all, that thou art not inconſtant or unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but rather too much conſtant perſiſting and ſtiff in thy purpoſe, hard to be moved, ſtiffe-necked, continuing to the end, tough, and hard to be overcome.</p>
               <p>All which may be manifeſtly proved by the courſe of my life, by the adventures that by thy appointment have chanced and happened unto me, which all of them have béen ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſo infortunate, and ſo unluckie, that it were a hard matter to judge which of them deſerveth the ſuperiority in name and title of infelicity. In all which my abverſities, thou haſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantly remained in thy envious and malicious frowardneſſe, that in this my latter miſhap thou haſt not any whit deflected or turned aſide from that cruelty which thou dideſt uſe againſt me in all my other misfortunes. What ſhall I then ſay? ſhall I call thee conſtant becauſe I am forced to ſay that thou art inconſtant or mutable? No, no, conſtancy is too laudable a vertue to be attributed to ſuch a ſpightfull and hard-necked
<pb facs="tcp:165993:113"/> Goddeſſe. Thou art not conſtant, becauſe not inconſtant, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extremity which corrupteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue is as contrary to vertue as vertue to vice. Inſomuch that I cannot attribute unto thée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of conſtant, unleſſe it be in envy, ſpight and cruelty, for ſo thou art ever, &amp; in hatred, rancor, &amp; malice, doeſt thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I that have thus long moſt zealouſly made thy altar ſmoak, by reaſon of the incenſe which I have always from my cradle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto thee, will and do now forſake and leave thee, as knowing at laſt, and acknowledging the errour and hereſie wherewith I have thus long been infected. Hereafter ſhall not <hi>Coreandro</hi> ſerve thee any more, or offer thee ſacrifice, ſeeing thou haſt not onely ſpoyled him of his goods and riches, but alſo deprived him firſt of his dear and well-beloved <hi>Delbia,</hi> and now at laſt, of his dear ſon <hi>Philorenus,</hi> whom thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be moſt barbarouſly killed and murthered fn his childhood, and left me alive to bewail and lament his untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la death.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:114"/>
               <p>My father hearing the latter end of the Captains plaints, marvelling what he might be that ſo railed at fortune for an other mans miſhap and miſchance; for he having heard him repeat the injury which ſhe had offered <hi>Coreandro,</hi> he thought he had meant of himſelf, and went into a certain thicket, where he ſaw the man that ſo blamed and exclaimed againſt Fortune for her ſevere and cruel dealings with <hi>Coreandro,</hi> in depriving him of his lawfull wife <hi>Delbia,</hi> and his welbeloved ſon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus:</hi> but becauſe he knew him not, nor remembred that he had ever ſéen him before that time, marvelled greatly what he ſhould be, and how he came to know him and mee, for he had heard him name both him and me.</p>
               <p>Wherefore after he had well looked on him, and throughly beheld him, he ſpake unto him in this order. Sir, I pray you not to be diſpleaſed with me for preſſing ſo near you ſéeing the cauſe which moveth me thereunto, procéedeth not from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or intent to trouble or injure you any way, but rather from love and affection, deſiring and wiſhing to comfort or pleaſure you according to my power, which by Fortunes fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe is ſo impaired and weakened, that my good will is more to be regarded then my ability. I perceive by your face and heavy countenance, that you have ſome cauſe to exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fortune either for your ſelf, or for ſome other. But by the way, I am moved by the remembrance of the good amity and great friendſhip which in times paſt hath been betwixt me and <hi>Coreandro</hi> (whoſe miſhap in loſing his wife and ſon I heard y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſo pittifully to lament) to be ſo bold as to ask you why <hi>Coreandros</hi> caſe ſo grieveth you, as that he himſelf could not more bewail his own misfortune, or be more grieved thereat, then you are?</p>
               <p>The good Captain not knowing my father more then he was known by my father, framed him this anſwer. Good ſir, though I had had any occaſion (as I have had none) to be diſpleaſed at your coming to me, yet by reaſon that you have been ſo well acquainted with <hi>Coreandro,</hi> as you ſay, your coming unto me, could not but have been ſo welcome unto me, that all diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:165993:114"/> would quickly have been baniſhed and forgotten. For the great love and affection which I bear unto that man, and did bear to his wife <hi>Delbia,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Philorenus,</hi> above all other creatures in the world, is the cauſe that I ſo lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his miſerable and pittifull miſhap. Wherefore ſéeing I have anſwered your queſtion, I pray you tell me where you have been ſo acquainted with <hi>Coreandro?</hi> Where (quoth my father?) in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Aragon,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> at <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> and in every place where <hi>Coreandro</hi> himſelf hath been, inſomuch that he was no where, but I was with him, nor I any where but he was by me. But I pray you (quoth my brothers father) do you know him if you ſee him? Should I not know him (quoth my father?) As well as my ſelf. Why then (quoth the Captain my brothers father) you know that I am <hi>Coreandro,</hi> do you not? Nay (quoth my father) rather do you know that I am the man, Then I perceive (ſaid the other) that you came to mock with me, and ſo intreated me not to be diſpleaſed with you, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give me cauſe of diſpleaſure before you meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me. Nay verily (anſwered my father) now I mark what the matter is; you knew that I was to paſſe this way, and therefore you came to this place to lament the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Coreandro,</hi> to draw and entice me to come unto you, and ſo to be mocked and laughed at. But know whatſoever thou art, that if thou be ſo favoured of fortune, that thou chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeſt licence to ſcoff at them that by fortunes ſpight are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to grieve for their croſſe hap, thou maiſt ſo be puniſhed by the juſt jugement of the revenging Gods, that thou ſhalt be moved to cry <hi>peccavi</hi> too late, and to acknowledge thy offence, when it will be too late for thee to repent.</p>
               <p>The good Captain hearing my father ſo earneſt, wiſt not what he might think of the matter; but he began to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that his wives firſt husband was called <hi>Coreandro,</hi> and that he alſo had a ſon called <hi>Philorenus.</hi> But becauſe he thought that he had been dead long ago, he could not think it ſhould be he; eſpecially becauſe it ſéemed by him, how that he had lived af <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> and that his ſon <hi>Philorenus</hi> (that is my ſelf) ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:165993:115"/> have been killed of the ſame ſouldiers that had ſlain his own ſon, who was alſo called <hi>Philorenus,</hi> for the ſame reaſon which hath already been told you. For it ſeemed ſcarce credible to him, that the other <hi>Coreandro</hi> and his ſon, whom he thought both to have been dead long ſince, ſhould have lived ſo near him, and that he ſhould not have heard of him; yet he thought beſt to ſet aſide all anger, that in caſe it were he, he might ſhun all occaſion of ſtrife and immoderate ſpeeches: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he ſaw my father ſo hot, yet he nothing changed, ſpake thus cooly to him. Sir, I neither knew of your coming by this way nor ever ſaw you or knew you before to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and therefore the Gods puniſh me with their wrath if I tither ſcoff or mock with you: but as I came from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> being over-burthened with the ſorrow which I conceive for the loſſe of my child, which was killed at the ſaid village by the barbarous ſouldiers, I entred into this grove, &amp; was forced by the muliitude of my miſeries, and greatneſſe of my grief to rail at that moſt cruel Goddeſſe Fortune, who taketh delight to glut her ſelf with the overthrow of mortal men. And was your ſon (quoth my father) called <hi>Philorenus?</hi> Yea, that he was (quoth he.) And was your wife (quoth my father) called <hi>Delbia?</hi> She was, anſwered he again. Why then, quoth my father, if thou be <hi>Coreandro,</hi> thy wife <hi>Delbia,</hi> and thy ſon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorenus,</hi> what ſhall I be with my <hi>Delbia,</hi> and my <hi>Philorenus?</hi> For if I am not <hi>Coreandro</hi> that had to wife <hi>Delbia,</hi> on whom I begot <hi>Philorenus</hi> now maſſacred at <hi>Ginqueni,</hi> heaven plague me.</p>
               <p>The good Knight hearing my father ſo ſolemnly proteſt that he was <hi>Coreandro,</hi> deſired him to make him ſome copious and true relation of his life, what he was, where he was born, in what place he was married, and by what fortune he was brought into <hi>Italy;</hi> and how that then he would ſatisfie him in all points, and ſo content and certifie him that he ſhould not only know, that he did not jeſt nor mock with him, but alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and acknowledge, that he had very great reaſon to think himſelf mocked of him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:115"/>
               <p>Whereupon my father very largely rehearſed unto him, the whole diſcourſe and hiſtory of his life, whereby the good Knight knew that hee was that <hi>Coreandro</hi> whom hee thought had been dead, and therefore had married his wife <hi>Delbia</hi> by whom he had his ſon <hi>Philorenus.</hi> And preſently he told my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all whatſoever had hapned and chanced between my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Delbia</hi> and him, how he ſaved her from the villany which the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> intended to uſe againſt my mother, how he brought her to her village houſe to look for him, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there, they went to the city <hi>Targonna</hi> to ſeek him: and how they afterwards underſtood of certainty that he was dead, as he could verifie and prove by divers of his wives friends at the City <hi>Targonna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, he told my father in like manner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> coming out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtle to eſcape the better, he called himſelf <hi>Coreandro.</hi> And when he was come forth, he being credibly informed of his death, married <hi>Delbia,</hi> and that he had within a year after a ſon by her, whom ſhe would have alſo named <hi>Philorenus,</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her firſt <hi>Philorenus,</hi> whom ſhe ſuppoſed to be dead. In a word, he left nothing untold, but let him know the cauſe of his wife my mothers death, with his voyage to <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> and all other things that hapned even till their meeting.</p>
               <p>My father greatly rejoyced at this diſcourſe, partly for that he heard ſuch particularities of his wife, of whom what was become, he never had heard any certainty, and partly alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was disburthened of that heavie load of falſe ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bred in his breaſt by reaſon of the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> odious proclamation made againſt my mother <hi>Delbia.</hi> For until the very hour that the good Knight, the other <hi>Coreandro</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philorenus</hi> his father, had informed him of the true veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all matters concerning my mother <hi>Delbia,</hi> did he verily think and perſwade himſelf, that my mother of wantonneſſe got ſecretly away from the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> not to ſeek him her husband, but to run away with the Knight, and lewdly to live with him, ſetting aſide and quite giving over her kind love, and amiable kindneſſe which ſhe was wont to profeſſe to
<pb facs="tcp:165993:116"/> her <hi>quondam</hi> dear husband. And therefore now knowing the contrary, although he made excéeding ſorrow for her death, yet the perſwaſion which reaſon by means of the good Knights true and not diſſembled relation, had ingrafted in his heart of her loyalty, did not a little comfort him in this his ſingular perplexity, both for the loſſe of ſo good a wife, and ſo dear a ſon. And beſides all this, the company of ſo valiant and worthy a Knight, and vertuous a perſon, (in all points as little behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fortune for proſperity as himſelf, ſéeing they both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the death of one woman, and eſpecially the pitifull miſhap of us their ſons (thinking that we were maſſacred at <hi>Cinqueni</hi>) which were unto each of them moſt pleaſant objects to remember their <hi>Delbia</hi> our mother, and moſt ſure pawns and tokens of her chaſt and loyal love towards them our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) did breed him ſuch ſolace, that he thanked the Gods for beſtowing ſo much comfort upon him in this his latter, and greateſt extremity. In like manner the good Knight <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares de Bazora,</hi> of late <hi>Coreandro,</hi> pouring out tears inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for joy of his good hap in méeting ſo luckily with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thought himſelf in ample manner beholding to the Gods for that ſingular benefit; profeſting that he could not, being in that caſe, have wiſhed for a more bleſſed day then that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſo happily met with my father. Thus joyning in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they marched together towards the City of <hi>Targonna</hi> in <hi>Aragon,</hi> intending there to live and die together, enjoying each others preſence, glad of each others company, having each of them loſt his ſon. Where I will leave them in this their journey, and return to the reſt of mine own fortunes, and my brothers, who now both of us were lifted up to high eſtate, and ſo proſperouſly lived in all kind of ſoveraign pleaſurs, that we thought it as poſſible for fortune to abaſe the greatneſſe of our weal, as for us to impair the divine eſtate of the heavenly powers.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end that I may let you underſtand how ſoon we were forced to recall our minds from that hereſie it may pleaſe you, moſt excellent Princeſſe and noble ſhepheards, to know, that we (I mean my brother and I) living in this moſt happy eſtate, began by reaſon of our great leaſure, which the peaceable quitneſſe of the Neapolitan E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate yéelded us, ſo to give our ſelves to all kind of ſports and pleaſures, that we thought that day ill ſpent, wherein we had not invented ſome new delight to pleaſure our Miſtreſſes withal. Now we invented new kinds of dances, now ſtrange manners of Vaulting, now rare Maſques, now new deviſed Enterludes, and in one word, all kind of toys that Italian wits had bred in times paſt, we either altered or augmented; wherein we uſed ſuch dexterity, that we ſéemed to have been born to that purpoſe. But howſoever we behaved our ſelves therein we were ſo liked of all the Courtiers of both ſexes, that our company was gratefull to all men, and ſhunned by no man. The King the Queen, and <hi>Hyppolito</hi> the young Prince, ſo loved and favoured us, that they would not denie us any thing that we could ask. And we, as we found our ſelves to be brothers (having the ſame Name, Parents, Countrey, Shape, &amp; fortune) ſo we ſwore everlaſting friendſhip, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance one to another, ſo loving one the other, that though I know that it were impoſſible for any man in the world ſo to love any one as I loved him, yet am I forced by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wonderfull deſerts towards me, and by the tryal which I have had of his loyalty, to doubt whether my love or his were the greateſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:117"/>
               <p>And becauſe we would in all things be alike, and deprive the world of all means to know and diſcern one of us from the other, we continually apparelled our ſelves alike, both in the ſame colour, faſhion, and order. Inſomuch that it was hard for the beſt diſcerning wit that the world could bring forth, to know the one from the other, or to find any difference between us. Which thing, as generally it troubled moſt of all the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſo particularly it was cauſe of <hi>Ceraſillacs</hi> death, who (as I told you before) bearing me good will, and taking my brother for me, when ſhe conveyed him out of priſon, and ſaved his life, and having loſt him in the wood, afterwards alſo deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from the villainous Egyptians, and ſo was cauſe of all our bliſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:117"/> of Counteſſe <hi>Verina,</hi> who being a moſt beautifull Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, named Miſtreſſe <hi>Aureola,</hi> ſo inchanted my mind by the commanding force of her ſwéet face and ſugred tongue, that I admiring the much decent colour of the one, and the well governed volubility of the other, was ſo raviſhed in the pleaſing delight which her perfections cauſed in my heart, that I judged no woman fair, none witty, and none eloquent, but golden <hi>Aureola.</hi> Who as ſhe paſſed all women in comelineſſe of body, and pure ſnow-like whiteneſſe of skin, ſo none came near her in thoſe hidden qualities which bred in the brain and foſtred in the heart, are made known by the tongue. But to be ſhort, ſuch were her graces both inward and outward, that they pierced my heart in ſuch manner, that I was forced to acknowledge my ſelf her ſervant, and <hi>Cupids</hi> captive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubdued by his policy in uſing the imperiall beams of her beauty, inſtead of darts to infringe and break the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my liberty. Well, I loved <hi>Aureola,</hi> and ſo loved <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola,</hi> that for the love of <hi>Aureola</hi> I could have hated my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I then being in this caſe, began to imploy my brains in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out manner, and procuring means to make my affection known to the Saint I ſo truly honoured. And truly in ſhort time not <hi>Aureola's</hi> ſelf onely, but my brother alſo, began to perceive the fire which being kindled in my heart, did caſt out ſuch a cloud of love-ſmoak. Now I glad that <hi>Aureola</hi> knew the manner of my ſickneſſe, but gladder that ſhe ſeemed not male-content of my welcontentedneſſe, and nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that my brother was acquainted with my paſſion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was an <hi>Alterego,</hi> my ſelf in. I will not ſay another body, (for it was too like mine to be differenced) but another place; thought my ſelf the happieſt man that lived.</p>
               <p>Ye may judge how much more bleſſed I would have accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf to have been, if <hi>I</hi> might have doubled my ſingle life by marriage with her. Vnto whom to lay open the pain which puniſhed my heart for the cauſe of her, <hi>I</hi> ſought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion very diligently. Inſomuch that opportunity being
<pb facs="tcp:165993:118"/> preſented unto me within a few days after, and eſpying her walking by her ſelf and the trées alone in the garden, where her ſiſters lodging was, I thought it but a negligent part to omit that fortunate hour, and therefore knowing that the Counteſſe her ſiſter was gone to the Quéen, I poſted to my miſtreſſe with a ſound courage, hoping to return victorious, or with good hope of victory. Into the Garden I ſtepped, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet on half a dozen paces forwards towards her; I might ſée her turn, being at the end of the walk. Whoſe heavenly face ſo dazeled mine eys with the glance that ſhe caſt from the other end of the garden, that I ſoon acknowledged, that no Sun could ſo have dimmed my eys, but the double <hi>Titan</hi> which like two little worlds of grace are ſuch ornaments to her face, that as they are beholding to it for that it hourdeth them, ſo is it bounden unto them becauſe it is by them adorned and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
               <p>At length I came ſo near her, that manners warned me to ſalute her, though I was ſo aſtoniſhed at her celeſtial ſhape, that I could more fixe mine eys to behold her with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then faſhion my mouth to ſalute her with civility. Yet love taught me to beware of committing ſo foul and groſſe a fault, as not to give her a courteous good morrow, who was the efficient of my diſquiet evenings. Therefore gréeting her after the humbleſt and lovingeſt manner my paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forced me ſhe anſwered me after this manner. Good morrow ſir Knight, you are very maticuous this morning, whatſoever the cauſe be; but I pray you what weather drove you towards theſe quarters ſo early? Truly Madam (quoth I) my good fortune: ſéeing I have met with no worſe company then your ſwéet ſelf. For as I paſſed by the Garden wall, by chance looking over with a long neck, I eſpied you walking by your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and ſo I thought it good manners to ſtep near and give you the <hi>buen giorno.</hi> And if I thought that my boldneſſe in preſſing ſo near you, perhaps in ſuch time as you had rather give reſpite to your ſolitary delight, then otherwiſe be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſhould offend you; as I came intending not to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:165993:118"/> you, ſo I would depart without performing any thing whereby you might have occaſion to be diſcontented. No, no, ſir Knight (quoth ſhe) beſhrew me if ever I could be offended with good company, neither have I any ſuch melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as to delight in beeing alone, but that ſometimes I am compelled to be ſolitary for lack of good company. And then I muſt of neceſſity walk alone, and recreate my ſelf with viewing natures diligent buſineſſe in beautifying the earth with ſuch pleaſant ornaments and fair tapeſtry, as paſſeth all artificial induſtry, I mean theſe fine herbs and flowers, which both in ſmell and colour ſo delight humane ſences, that we muſt needs acknowledge our ſelves beholding to dame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for preſenting us with ſuch a worthy kind of delectation. But you are now come even in good time to let me know your opinion in one thing that I am breaking my brain upon. What is that Madam (quoth I?) Marry (quoth ſhe) this. You ſée here Violets Roſes, and Lillies, growing all together in one place, I have béen muſing with my ſelf a great while which of all theſe three ſhould bear away the praiſe, if queſtion were made which of them were the fineſt flower; for I promiſe you, in my mind they ſeem to ſtrive each with other in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. They do verily Madam (quoth I) and ſeeing you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have my fooliſh verdite in judgement of their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I think in this caſe, we ought to have a regard unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures intent, and take advice of her who ſeemeth to uſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the manner of the growing of theſe flowers, that the Roſe-buſh grows thick and untowardly, the Roſe budding out in divers places without order, and ſeemeth rather to ſerve for a wall or hedge to environ other flowers, as is apparent by the intent of him that hath planted theſe roſes as the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain running about the bed where he placed the Lillies. In like manner the Violet alſo groweth confuſedly and low, cloſe to the ground to be token humility, and ſo the Gardener hath planted them in this place to be as it were the foot-cloath and coverlet to ſhrowd the homely face of the earth from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſpect of the ſtately Lillies, which growing moſt proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:165993:119"/> on one ſtalk, being erected moſt ſtraightly, and bearing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, ſéem to challenge the ſupremacy. Inſomuch, Madam, that my opinion, following the intent both of Nature and the planter, is to crown the Lilly with the garland, bearing title of the fineſt flower, as unto which, I déem all flowers inferiour for divers reſpects. And therefore no doubt did <hi>Juno</hi> the Quéen of heaven, challenge the Lilly as preſently belonging to her calling it her Roſe: for thereby hath and is the Lilly yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Junonis roſa.</hi> By my faith, ſir <hi>Philorenus</hi> (qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th ſhe) you have ſaid prettily well as touching this matter. But yet me thinks we ought to conſider the inward vertue of the flowers as well as the outward bravery. The Lilly is ſtately indéed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet the Roſe it ſerveth for many good uſes, and being either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerved is kept a long time ln Apothecaries ſhops, to be miniſtred unto men in their ſickneſſe, whereas the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly onely ſerveth for the ſences of ſmelling or ſight, and being fully opened, is either with the wind blown of, or withereth and decayeth in the pride of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> being mounted in his noon-point. Nay but Madam (quoth I) I think you formed your queſtion which was the ſineſt flower, which I meant not for the vertues or natural efficacy of the flower, but rather the exteriour ſhape and ſhew thereof. And yet I doubt not but the Lilly hath many hidden and ſecret vertues; for I have have heard that the water of the ſame flower, yea and of the herb thereof is very good for divers purpoſes, which by hap you better know then I my ſelf, ſéeing they be peculiar and proper to your ſex. Well, well (quoth ſhe) be it ſo ſir <hi>Philorenus;</hi> But as you well mentioned, I underſtand the matter as you do, and move not the queſtion for the interiour quality, but for the exteriour accidents.</p>
               <p>Compare then the Roſe to the Lilly, what fairer ſight can the cleareſt diſcerning eye ſée then a Roſe, ſo providently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Nature, that it ſéemeth rather to be ſome artificial col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of leaves wrought by ſcience, then a natural bud ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf abroad, and making ſhew of ſuch a glorious beauty as all the moſt learned workmen of <hi>Italy</hi> cannot do the like.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:119"/>
               <p>I perceive Madam (quoth I) that you are an eſpecial favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to the Roſe, but for my part the Lill ſhally bear away the honour: for if you ſtand upon the form or faſhion of the flower, I pray you how can a fairer or better made flower be ſéen then the Lilly? which being made in the form of a Bell with the Clapper in it, hath béen by divers Ladies called <hi>Campana Virginea,</hi> the Virgins Bell And to ſay no leſſe then is true, me thinks it well deſerves the ſame name, ſéeing it doth in ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growth, reſemble the well-faſhioned proportion and ſtately countenance of maids, in colour their whiteneſs, and in the yellowneſs of the ſéed, the golden locks of their glorious hair: inſomuch that divers parts are beholding unto the Lilly for arguments of ſimilitude and compariſon which it yéeldeth them, thereby to exorn and commend the whiteneſs of divers Gentlewomen, whoſe praiſes they penned, ſaying they were Lilly white, like Lillies ſtately, ſoft and ſlick as Lillies, and as the Lilly ſo ſweet. And to aver a very truth, what is there of all ſweet ſwéet ſcents comparable to the ſweet ſwéetneſs of the Lilly? Nay ſtay there ſir <hi>Philorenus</hi> (quoth ſhe) for what ſwéeter ſmell can the niceſt noſe wiſh for, then that which the Roſe yéeldeth: for in my judgement the Roſe caſteth the moſt glowing ſmell of any other flower. The moſt glowing ſmell indeed Madam (quoth I;) for it is of ſuch a forcible and ſtrong ſcent, that it giveth ſufficient notice to men, that it is bitter in taſt. And to ſay that which muſt be ſaid, in my phantaſie, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth too ſtrong a ſmell to be compared to the ſugred ſweetneſs and ſwéet delicateneſs of the dainty Lilly, which yéeldeth the choiſeſt ſmell, and moſt fragrant ſcent that can be. But in the mean time ſir <hi>Philorenus</hi> (uuoth ſhe) whileſt you magnifie tho Lilly, and I the Roſe, the forgotten Violet may juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the wrong we offer it, that we ſo contend &amp; ſtrive to ſet forth the praiſe of the Roſe and the Lilly, that we give no commendation to it, though it deſerve to be highly eſtéemed: notwithſtanding that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſaid before, that it grew low in token of baſeneſs. And ſéeing you do ſo ſtoutly ſtand for your ſtately Lilly me thinks I dare nevertheleſs compare the baſe Violet
<pb facs="tcp:165993:120"/> as you term it, to the proud Lilly. For doth not the ſweet Marjoram grow lower then the rank Fern? and yet how far the lower excels the taller in ſwéetneſs and virtue, you will not, nay you cannot deny. In like manner the fragrant Time, ſo beloved of the painful, grows cloſe to the ground, where the Broom ſprouts very high; yet is the Time of other virtue than the Broom. And ſo of many more flowers which I néed not mention, ſéeing one or two may ſerve for an inſtance to falſifie your ſmall reaſons. But I pray madam (quoth I) deal not ſo ſophiſtically with me, as to argue with me a <hi>Male conjunctis.</hi> For I ſay not that the Lilly is the fineſt flower becauſe it grows higheſt, for ſo I would grant my reaſon were but fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded; neither do I ſay, that the Lilly deſerves the head praiſe among all flowers becauſe it grows not confuſedly, but in decent and comely order; for there are many flowers that growing diſorderly, in ſwéetneſs of ſcent ſurpaſs divers well ranked flowers; and laſtly, I ſay not that the Lilly is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt flower becauſe it is ſo ſwéet a flower: but thus I form my reaſon. That, ſtately ſtatelineſs, white whiteneſs, gallant gallantneſs, and ſwéet ſwéetneſs, all theſe predominant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties méeting together in the bravo Lilly, make her worthy to be honored as the faireſt, fineſt, and braveſt flower that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath framed.</p>
               <p>By this the Counteſs <hi>Verina</hi> being come to her lodging, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs <hi>Aureola</hi> was to retire from the garden to her ſiſter, and ſo I was forced to leave her, having miſſed of my purpoſe, and no time to break my mind to her in plain words, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt our diſpute concerning the excellency of flowers, I uſed ſuch paſſionate looks, that ſhe might well perceive whereto my diſcourſe tended; but howſoever ſhe thought of it, I know not, but our parting was ſo amiable, that after I had loſt the ſight of her, I felt that I parted from her without parting. For my body might well be contained in ſome other place than hers, but my mind followed her whereſoever ſhe went, as truſtily as her own ſhadow.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the mean time (excellent Princes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thy ſhepheards) you may note that my brother loved her (I mean my golden <hi>Aureola</hi>) as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely as I my ſelf, his love being unknown to me. For though he knew that I loved her, yet was I not as yet acquainted with the love that he bore <hi>Aureola.</hi> And in truth, becauſe he knew ſhe was the onely air by which I lived, rather then he would do any thing to procure my diſquiet, reſolved himſelf to die for love of <hi>Aureola,</hi> rather then he ſhould opportunate <hi>Aureola</hi> to love him, and to deprive me of that without which I could not live. Inſomuch that although he ſo loved her, that for her he would willingly have yeelded to death, and reſigned his life, yet he no way to offend me, did not onely conceal his love from <hi>Aureola,</hi> but alſo occaſion being offered him to talk with her, did ſpend all that time in commendation of me, proteſting unto her, that I was ſo faithfull, conſtant and loyal, that if ſhe would dain to reward my love with love, and if ſhe did love me, ſhe would have cauſe to glory of her hap in fancying him, and placing her love on him, who would prove the faithfulleſt <hi>Amant</hi> that was in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, he made divers verſes in praiſe of her, and together with ſundry brave and precious jewels preſented them vnto her, ſaying that I had ſent them; whereas in truth I knew not any thing of them. Inſomuch that more by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry then mine own diligence (though I neglected no duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervice required in that caſe) at length I obtained the love of mine <hi>Aureola.</hi> For ſhe loved me ſo affectionately, that I might judge her love to be of as great force as mine, though indeed it was of ſuch nature, that it was divided between us
<pb facs="tcp:165993:121"/> both, I mean my brother and me, for we being ſo like one to other that we ſeemed to be but one, we could not ſhun reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation in love; but whoſoever loved me, could not but love him, and whoſoever loved him, could not but love me. And although <hi>I</hi> had certainly known that <hi>Aureola</hi> loved my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equally with me, as well as <hi>I</hi> did but gueſſe that it was ſo, yet had <hi>I</hi> been nothing ſorrie, but rather rejoyced greatly that <hi>I</hi> had obtained ſo fair a Lady to be both my love, and my brothers friend. For in verity ſuch was my affection towards him, that <hi>I</hi> could not wiſh any thing to my ſelf wholly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wiſhing part of it unto my brother, being moſt ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways willingly to part from any thing which <hi>I</hi> knew he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and with a good heart to ceaſe and leave from deſiring or wiſhing any ſuch thing whatſoever he had a mind unto. But my brother marking that <hi>Aureola</hi> could not tell which of us two ſhe loved beſt, or which of us was moſt worthy of her love, and thereby equally loved us both, was very ſorry, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt I might be grieved that <hi>I</hi> did not my ſelf onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the love of <hi>Aureola.</hi> And therefore he began to exhort me to ſéek means to be joined unto her in marriage, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo ſhee ſhould bee forced to withdraw her love from him, and wholly be addicted to me being her wedded husband. To effect which matter, ſhe continually urged <hi>Aureola</hi> to make promiſe of marriage unto me very forcibly perſwading her thereto; and telling her that <hi>I</hi> who thought my life no life but in reſpect of hers, ſhould never be able to live perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time that I being united and tied unto her in the knot of wedlock, might enjoy her as my wife: untill which thing were brought to paſſe, I ſhould live a moſt lamentable life full of dolefull diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he promiſed her, that if ſhe would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to condiſcend to my honeſt deſire, and his earneſt requeſt, he would move the King and Quéene to deale with her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Counteſſe, and her other friends, about the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this marriage, and obtain their good will and conſent thereto. <hi>Aureola.</hi> although ſhe was very unwilling to do ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:121"/> yet becauſe he ſhould not think that ſhe would not grant my requeſt for that ſhe equally loved him with me, ſéemed to grant our requeſt, and to be willing to have the marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived betwéen her and my ſelf. Yet ſhe would not have any mention made of it unto any of the Court till thrée moneths were ended, for certain reſpects which moved her to conceal the matter ſo long. Which were none other (as afterwards we knew by experience) but ſuch as proceeded from her own unwillingneſs to be tyed to me, and ſo to be deprived of the love of my brother, For it afterwards was manifeſted, ſhe ſo loved us both that ſhe wiſhed in her heart, that ſhe might have béen married to us both; thinking that ſhe ſhould not perfectly have enjoyed one of us, if any other woman had been married to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judging that we were both but one, and ought not to be ſeparated. And therefore above all things did ſhe deſire that ſhe were beloved of us both, ſéeing we were both engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in her heart, that ſhe might not think of the one, without remembring the other.</p>
               <p>But my brother thinking that <hi>Aureola</hi> had a <hi>bonnefoy</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed after the time of three moneths expired, to marry with me, made me glad with the news which he brought me of her mind, although himſelf therewith was utterly ſpoiled of his felicity and welfare, which I came to know by this means.</p>
               <p>It happened even upon the expiring of thrée moneths, on a certain morning betime, that I riſing ſomthing early, walked abroad in the fields without the City, to a little wsod not far off, to recreate my ſelf with a ſolitary walk, being as it were wearied with the turbulent multitude of people, both Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and Courtiers. Which wood, when I had but even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, me thought I heard one ſorely lamenting his eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the voice knowing that it was my brothers, I liſtened very attentively to know the cauſe of his complaints, whom I heard thus to cry out againſt fickle fortune.</p>
               <p>Yea, Fortune, yea, Thou art Miſtreſs, and wilt be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Philorenus</hi> muſt teſtifie the ſame, and regiſter in the
<pb facs="tcp:165993:122"/> bottome of his heart, that he was born to be croſſed by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I thought that the Gods had forbidden thee to vex me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, but I perceive thou wilt do what thou wilt, though heaven deny. But accurſed mayeſt thou be of heaven, earth and hell, for ſo denying mortal wights, that thou ſéemeſt to have no Deity, but ſuch as is procured by the glory which thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt in making men miſerable. Yet why do I ſo blame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſéeing that if another man were in my caſe, he would think himſelf infinitely beholding to her, in cauſing all things to fall out ſo agreeing to his humour. For thou loveſt <hi>Aureola,</hi> how much thou knoweſt; then ſéeing thou haſt had ſufficient token of her love towards thee, and conſidering that he that loveth deſireth nothing ſo much as mutualſy to be loved of her whom he doth love. how canſt thou complain of Fortune?</p>
               <p>Again, when your mind was ſuch that you wiſhed her to be wholly your brothers, and deſired that ſhe ſhould be his wife, you ſée al things happen to your pleaſure, conſidering that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola</hi> hath promiſed to marry her ſelf to him, and yet you will will exclaim againſt Fortune: all this is true. But the Hag doth let all things fall out according to my mind, knowing that in doing ſo ſhe doth moſt torment me. For ſhe hath made my life ſo miſerable, that no content can be harboured in my diſquiet breaſt, being the very habitacle of reſtleſs thoughts.</p>
               <p>And in this thing is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means which ſhe uſeth in vexing me contrary to all other miſhaps and evils, in that ſhe vexeth me with effecting thoſe things the effect of which I moſt wiſh for and deſire. Which thing how ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it is I leave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe that have the uſe of their wits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſéeing by fortunes envie I am my ſelf deprived of that benefit. Alack, what ſhall then poor <hi>Philorenus</hi> do, ſeeing he is ſo entangled in the love of <hi>Aureola</hi> that he muſt either die or injoy her as his own? and yet ſo loveth his brother (who cannot in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner live if ſeparated from the ſame <hi>Aureola</hi>) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:165993:122"/> there be two <hi>Philorenus</hi>'s, make thy ſelf lifeleſs and thy brother happy, he being one <hi>Philorenus</hi> alone, and enjoying one onely <hi>Aureola,</hi> And put caſe thou wert dead, <hi>Philorenus,</hi> and dead for no other purpoſe but to make thy brother happy in the higheſt degrée, oh how ſwéet a death would ſuch a death be unto thée! But yet thou mighteſt be deceived; for thou knoweſt, nay ſo knoweſt that thou canſt not doubt, but that, that life will be but a bitter life unto him, thou being without life, and ſo thou mightſt by thy death procure to him either a bitter death, or a life worſe then any death. What then reſteth thrice miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretch, if that thou canſt neither live to thy mind, nor die to thy mind? Die living and live dying, and yeeld thy heart to receive each print of grief; that thou mayeſt always die, being torn with tormenting pain, and yet never be dead, leaſt thy plague rebound from thée to thy brother: and therefore I bid thée farewel <hi>Aureola,</hi> farewel, my brother muſt enjoy thee, and I muſt ſuffer you both.</p>
               <p>After that he had ſo ſhut up his complaint, as if he had ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the ſeal of death, he fell down on the ground, being unable to ſtand on his feet any longer, &amp; there he lay ſtrugling as if ſoul and body would have parted, ſo ſtrong and vehement was the pang that pinched him. Inſomuch, that although I was loath to ſhew my ſelf vnto him there, leſt he ſhould know that I had heard and ſeen him, yet compaſſion becomming maſter amongſt my affections, for that he needed help in that caſe, forced me to runne happily to him to aid him. But he no ſooner eſpied me but leaped up again ſo ſuddenly that if I had not both ſeen and heard his former ſcrikes and cries, I would have ſurely been perſwaded that he did but ſhew me a tumbling trick, and that he had been exerciſing his body to ſome acts of nimbleneſſe.</p>
               <p>And beſides alſo, before I could ſalute him by reaſon that I ſo marvelled at the ſtrangeneſſe of his change, he ſpake unto me ſo chearfully that I could ſcarce anſwer him for admiring at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force which his love towards me had ſuddenly procured him. His legs were ſcarce able to hold his body, and ſeeing me
<pb facs="tcp:165993:123"/> his heart commanded them to ſupport him, his eys which were ſo hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the tears which he ſhed, that no man could have ſéen them, as ſoon as they beheld me, ſéemed to have recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the flouds that came out of them and to have in a moment ſwallowed them up, and his face which did as it were ſwim in tears, ſeemed to drink up the moiſture at my comming, as the morning dew vaniſheth in the preſence of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> when he ſendeth his golden beams from his fiery chariot, to cheriſh the pleaſant fruits of the earth after they have wept, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dark coldneſſe of the mirthleſſe night. Wherefore I ſéeing that my brotherly brother was ſo loth to make me acquainted with his paſſions, onely becauſe he would not give me occaſion of grief, but kept it all to himſelf; I diſſembled as much as I could, leſt I ſhould by letting him know what I knew, quite diſcomfort him, and truly make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe. And although by reaſon of that which I knew of him, pity cauſed ſuch grief in me for his diſcomfort and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate torment, that I think if he had not been in place, I had ſunk to the ground, for a ſtronger foundation to hold up my diſtracted body, oppreſſed and weighed down by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe of paſſing ſorrow, then my legs, which ſéemed to ſhake like the pillors of a Church that is falling, yet nevertheleſſe for that time, I plucked up my ſpirits, and though not ſo wel able as he, yet as wel as I could, I diſſembled my paſſion, and anſwered him as chearfully as poſſibly I might, entertaining him with ſuch talk as I thought moſt expedient, to cauſe him not to miſdoubt of any thing. Inſomuch that he neither thought that I had heard him, nor knew that I felt the pain which he himſelf ſuffered. And after we had there walked an half hour or thereabout, we returned both of us together to the Court. And as we paſſed by the Counteſſe <hi>Verina's</hi> Garden, he eſpied the Counteſſe walking all alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he began to urge me, in any caſe not to let that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſlip, but that I ſhould go unto her, and make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the love and affection betwéen me and her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Aureola,</hi> and that he would go with me to bear me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:123"/> and to perſwade the Counteſs to conſent to the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a marriage betwéen me and <hi>Aureola.</hi> He ſaid further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, conſidering the thrée moneths which <hi>Aureola</hi> appointed to have the matter during that time concealed, were expired, he had the day before ſpoken with the King concerning this matter, and that his Majeſty had promiſed him to be wholly ours in this point, as he had ever before béen in many other; and beſides told him ſome things which he ſhould make rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of to the Counteſſe, concerning this match. And to tell the truth, he grew ſo importunate to have me go to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe in all haſt, that I knew not how to ſhift off this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But becauſe I had purpoſed to bring that to paſſe which I will by and by ſhew unto you. I found this excuſe to delay our conference with the Counteſſe; that miſtreſſe <hi>Aureola</hi> for certain cauſes had urged me to promiſe her, that I would not ſpeak unto her ſiſter concerning any thing touching her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forewarned her, or let her know both that I would do it, and the time when I would do it. Which promiſe (quoth I) being paſſed, I may not break it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he well contented, ſéemed to take my excuſe ſo well, that he rather liked of my unwillingneſſe to go to the Counteſſe, then perſevered to perſwade me thereunto. So that we went both to my lodging, where we began to read certain chronicles of the ancient eſtate of <hi>Italy;</hi> things done in times paſt in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> to drive away the reſt of the time till dinner were ready, that we might have ſome ancient hiſtory or other to delight the King and the Queen withall while they dined. For they took ſuch delight in hearing their predeceſſours déeds and ſayings, that we could not have done them a greater pleaſure then to rehearſe either ſome pretty ſaying, or ſome other worthy act of ſuch Kings or Quéens as had before them ſwayed the ſcepter of <hi>Naples.</hi> But not to be that which I am loath to be, I mean tedious unto you (noble Princes and ſhepheards,) I will haſten to that which I even now promiſed to let you know, concerning that which I had certainly of rips counſell in my heart concluded
<pb facs="tcp:165993:124"/> to do, after I knew by my brothers paſſions that he himſelf loved <hi>Aureola,</hi> and yet continually furthered my deſire to his uttermoſt part.</p>
               <p>For indeed I was fully reſolved to leave <hi>Aureola</hi> unto him and my ſelf to the hazard of fortune, and being ſo reſolved, I performed no leſſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After my brother had miſſed me, marvelling where I ſhould be ſo long, he went to his chamber to drive away the time, and to deceive the tedious hours with ſome kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding exerciſe, thinking that I had been ſomewhere abroad in the fields in my ſolitary haunt, and that I would ere long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Court. And leaning on his window, he chanced to ſpie ſomething written on the cover-lid of his looking glaſſe, which he might ealſiy do, by reaſon that I had written with red ink the lid being of white ivory. And ſo taking it in his hand, he read the verſes which I had left there, to yeeld a reaſon for my ſudden departure. But he being raviſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiration, and by admiration led into aſtoniſhment, fell in an extaſie. Which extaſie, he being by himſelf alone, and therefore deprived of help, in ſuch a caſe required had almoſt brought him to his laſt home. Yet after he had a long time lain in a trance, he came at laſt to himſelf again and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to curſe and rail at fortune, for dealing ſo partially with him in revealing that unto me, the revealing of which onely could make him miſerable. Inſomuch that now he knew that which before he not once miſtruſted, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I the other morning had in the wood heard him lament his ill fortune, whereby I knew that which I alſo never dreamed of, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his loving of <hi>Aureola.</hi> But ſo grievouſly did he take my abſence, that all his body received the diſpoſition that is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a diſquiet ſoul; and his face became the very ſubject of ſorrow, his countenance being mournfull and his eys being grown to be the very ſeats of tears. Inſomuch that whereas no man as yet could ſuſpect or dream that I ſhould be ſo gone
<pb facs="tcp:165993:125"/> as I was, yet ſeeing him ſo wofully faſhioned, ſtraightways judged that he could not be ſo altered but upon ſuch a cauſe: and whereas they ſhould have known that he was ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by reaſon of my ſo being gone, they contrarily knew of my being gone by reaſon that he was ſo diſtempered. To be ſhort he was ſo tortured by the Butchers of <hi>Greece,</hi> that he was almoſt deprived of his wits and the uſe of his underſtanding: and the rather, becauſe he was brought in doubtfull reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he ſhould leave <hi>Aureola</hi> and follow me, or leave me and comfort <hi>Aureola;</hi> leſt ranging after me through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known places, he ſhould both loſe me and himſelf alſo. He therefore being drawen now to this concluſion, now to that, hung in the air hovering between heaven and earth not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he were beſt by ſlight reach to the one, or by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling come to the other. So that his mind being thus ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he perpended the reaſons for both parts, which were moſt forcible to perſwade him to the one or the other; yet in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that neglecting fully his own caſe, as one altogether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of his own welfare, he referred all matters to the effecting of that which ſeemed moſt expedient and neceſſary to make me happy, and to work my felicity. Inſomuch, that he began to conſider, that if chance he ſhould have left <hi>Aureola,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to the labourſome ſeeking and uncertain finding of me, the loving Gentlewoman might have taken the abſence of us both ſo heavily, that ſhe might have thereby fallen into ſome deſperate ſickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perchance remedileſs. Well (quoth he) put the caſe ſhould die, were it not better that ſhe ſhould die, then that I ſhould ſuffer my brother to live in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to run round about the world, to carry hell with him whereſoever he goeth, having his affections like furies and fiends, teaxing &amp; rending his brotherlike heart, to irrisate the barren ground with millions of tears, to diſturb the guiltleſs air with lamentable ſhrieks &amp; cries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accompanied with ſighs and ſobs, and in a word to be always dying, and yet never die? Death is the lock that ſhutteth up miſery, and endeth all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and trouble, If <hi>Aureola</hi> then die, O happy ſhe! but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb facs="tcp:165993:125"/> I! Nay my ſwéet brother, thrice unhappy thou, For no doubt if <hi>Aureola</hi> ſhould die, the pain which thou wouldeſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the grief which would moleſt thy ſoul, and the torment which would raviſh thee in the very gulph of all vexation, would ſo far in extremity paſs the anguiſh wherein thou now doeſt pine, that it would be greater then the pain which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſoul to depart from the body, Why then I will rather remain by <hi>Aureola,</hi> and ſo both ſave her life, thine and mine own, though ſcarce mine own, ſeeing that I ſhall ſcarce be able to live, he being abſent. And what will he think, nay what will all the world ſay, but that I (forſooth) for love of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, entertain his love and that I ſo love him, that to ſhew my love towards him, I muſt needs love his Lady, and ſo defraud him of that wherein his chiefeſt felicity conſiſteth; the jewel of his heart, the treaſure of his deſires, the object of his delight, the ſubject of his conceits, the hold of his hope, &amp; the onely and chief pillar of his life, and cauſe of his being, ſwéet <hi>Aureola,</hi> worthy to be all this unto him, he deſerving to be as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, none of them both owing leſs one to the other.</p>
               <p>As he was thus quite turning from that mind to the other, and reſolving to leave all to follow me, the beams of <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes</hi> beauty reverberating the window wherein he lay muſing what he might beſt do, warned him, that that Sun was in the garden, whoſe light was able to ſtrive with the Rays of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> for force, ſéeing that his beams may well ſhine upon men, not in them; whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bright lines that gliſter from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forehead of <hi>Aureola,</hi> did penetrate mens bodies, and ſhine, not upon them onely, but alſo within them and through them.</p>
               <p>He therefore eſpying <hi>Aureola</hi> walking in the garden alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wept that he ſaw not me with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, O ſacred powers of heaven, ſéeing that your Deities have been divinely worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by me ſince my Cradle, why hate ye poor <hi>Philorenus</hi> your Servant ſo, that the ſight which ought to be unto his eys as gold to the covetous man, is unto him as poyſon to them that wiſh to live long? Not for that I take any diſgrace by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence of <hi>Aureola,</hi> but that my joy is eclipſed, when
<pb facs="tcp:165993:126"/> I behold her without him by her, who ſeemed born to be inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably joyned with her as white unto ſnow cold to ice and to uſe a more familiar compariſon, as beauty to <hi>Aureola.</hi> Having ſo ſaid, as carried away with a ſudden ſtrong gale of wind he haſted to the garden, and having paſſed the courteſies uſed in ſalutation and gréeting, being asked for me (for ſhe knew him by reaſon of a ſecret token which we had given to her onely to diſcern him from me, and me from him) he up and told her all the matter concerning my ſudden departure, yet ſo colouring the cauſe thereof, that ſhe thought that I was gone, becauſe I deſpaired that ſhe ſhould love him better then me. For he thought, that ſo ſhe might be moved to pity, and by pity to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her affection, which ſhould have encreaſed her love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Whereas if he had let her know the true cauſe of my abſence, that I was gone to leave her to be his, ſhe might have been moved to diſdain me, which diſdain ſhould have nouriſhed the fire which was kindled in his breſt by the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhe bore him, and ſo might ſhe have allured him to to leave me in my pilgrimage, and enjoy her, to diſpleaſe whom he did count it a ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>But ſhe conſtruing of the matter as my moſt carefull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his brotherlike carefulneſs enformed and being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that cuſtome which by nature is an unſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the deſires of all women, I mean to wiſh and covet that which ſeems moſt impoſſible, and to long for ſuch things as cannot be gotten, or very hardly had: now ſhe heard that I was gone no man knew where, whereas before her love incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather to my brother then to me, ſhe was ſo raviſhed with deſire to be with me, that ſhe preſently concluded to her ſelf in heart, to take the pains to ſeek me: and although ſhe did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the ſame unto him, and diſſembled the paſſion which ſhe felt by reaſon of my abſence, by words whileſt he was by her; yet by deed ſhe ſufficiently afterwards ſhewed it unto all the world.</p>
               <p>For after ſhee was ſeparated from him by the haſtineſs of her reſolution to execute that which ſhe had purpoſed, ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:126"/> went to her chamber, where after ſhe had made her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief drunk with ſipping up and drinking in the tears which abundantly iſſued from out her eys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt fertilly yielding fruit of the ſéeds of ſorrow ſown in them; and having aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the ſtones and walls with the admirable ſhrieks, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the lifeleſs pictures that hung in her chamber to pity, ſhe impoveriſhed her rich apparel by laying it off, and enriched her ſiſters Cooks wives poor cloaths, putting them on her i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory body, and ſo making proviſion of nothing but a knife to conquer Fortunes envy, if chance ſhe would go about to make her miſerable in the higheſt degrée, by prolonging her life, when as ſhe could not live but diſcontented, ſhe committed her ſelf to her journey, and her journy to the Gods, calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Deities to be directed in her way.</p>
               <p>O ye ſacred powers (called ſhe) that in heaven take care of us poor mortals, who wholly depend upon your favour or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favor, if ever my vows have béen acceptable unto you, and my offerings pleaſing, let me now have you tender my caſe, and pity my eſtate.</p>
               <p>For if I have not of wicked wantonneſs or idle luſts fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſelf a fit ſubject for love, and made my mind a Tennis-court for the balls of fancy to be toſſed to and fro in it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been conquered by the force of not to be reſiſted love; then allow me to love and maintain my love in ſpight of Fortune. Let your imperial power command the winds by their blaſts to guide my ſteps, and by my ſteps to bring my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the bleſſed place that is made happy by the excellent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of my vertuous <hi>Philorenus.</hi> O thou lofty coach-man of the ſtately sky, in whoſe heavenly body are great hidden Deities, let thy cheriſhing beams exhilerate no place but that which ſerveth to ſupport the weight of my wofull and heavie <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus,</hi> therefore heavie becauſe mine: that ſo thy corruſcant Rays falling down as a Golden ſhower of Rain over him, may be as a token and a mark whereby I may direct the courſe of my voyage.

<pb facs="tcp:165993:127"/> made by nature, and challenged by the ſoveraign Gods, to be the habitacle and lodging for their Deities, help poor <hi>Aureola,</hi> help diſtreſſed her; and when <hi>Phoebus</hi> hath ſtabled his fiery horſes all weary with daily toil, and put on you the charge of guarding and watching the ſacred ſeals of heavenly powers, then take Chriſtal wings to your firie body, and flie through the air unto my ſouls <hi>Philorenus,</hi> that as he ſhall underſtand by your comming, <hi>Aureola,</hi> even poor ſhe is haſting towards him, ſo I, wretched I, (nay moſt happy I, if ever ſo fortunate as once again to behold him the paragon of vertue, and ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my conceits) following the light which environeth your bodies, may be brought unto him, even him, whoſe ſwéet ſelf onely is worthy to be ſought for of <hi>Aureola.</hi> Finally, chaſt and fair <hi>Diana,</hi> thou that knoweſt the purity of my thoughts and art acquainted with the furious aſſaults wherewith <hi>Cupid</hi> hath battered the bulwark of my chaſt mind, and ſhaken the fort of my conſtant purpoſe to inviolable chaſtity; yet, O mighty Goddeſs, ſéeing that I have not filthily or diſhoneſtly nouriſhed fancy with ſhamefull hope of luſt, but am rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by ſuch unreſiſtable love, that if it had been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſome Goddeſs, ſhe had been forced to yeeld; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to march before me in your ſecret night walks, that being comforted by thy divine preſence, I be not affrighted by the ugly grimneſs of the dark night, and ſo diſwaded, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcouraged to paſs through woods and dales after my <hi>Philorenus.</hi> O ſweet <hi>Philorenus,</hi> O beautifull <hi>Philorenus,</hi> O ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Philorenus!</hi> What wood is made ſo happy by thy miſhap, as to ſhroud thy face ſo fair from ſcorching <hi>Apollo?</hi> What green is made ſo fortunate by thy misfortune, as to become the bed whereon thou doſt reſt thy wearied body? What lake is grown to be ſo bleſſed by thy curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to refreſh thy tender ſtomack, falling down thy Alabaſter throat into thy Marble belly? Bleſſed be that wood, that green and that lake which ſerveth for his ſcarff, his bed, and his drink; ſeeing that Nature hath wiſhed, Fortune procured, and the Gods granted them that honourable favour.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:127"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>Aureola</hi> invoking the Gods, and calling upon heaven, betook her ſelf to her uncertain journey. She wiſt not which way to go, nor whither to go, but went being guided with love and accompanied with hope. In the mean time my brother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been informed that ſhe was ſecretly departed the Court, ſtaied not to hear what rumours were ſpread abroad in the Court of her going, but leſt he might be accuſed of negligence and careleſneſs of the welfare of ſo good a brother, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently went from <hi>Naples,</hi> but ſo that he took his leave of the King and Queen, promiſing to return, his brother being found, unto them again; having acquainted them with the true cauſe of my ſo leaving the Court without even any of their Majeſties knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee (Noble Princes and ſhepheards) how thoſe whom Nature ſeemed to have made to live together and be as one, were now by fortune ſeparated ſo far aſunder, that there was little (I will not ſay hope, for every one of us were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward with the ſpur of hope, being warmed with deſire, but) likelihood in reaſon that ever we ſhould ſee one another again.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow <hi>Aureola</hi> underſtanding by a ſhepheard, that about four days journey from <hi>Cinqueni,</hi> there was a moſt ſolemn feaſt to be celebrated by the ſhepheards of that whole Country, to the honour of their God <hi>Pan.</hi> within three or four days after that ſhe heard of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe knowing that I very greatly delighted to be at thoſe Paſtoral Solemnities, and conſidering that the report of the ſame feaſt was ſo famous, and the rumours thereof ſpread ſo general, hoped that it might be her good luck to find me there,
<pb facs="tcp:165993:128"/> ſuppoſing that I being warned of the feaſt to be kept, by the rumor and talk of the ſhepheards, and being led by the delight which I take in ſuch paſtimes, would have come thither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create my ſorrowfull and diſtreſſed mind, with the pleaſant ſport of the ſhepheards that celebrated the feaſt of their God. But ſhe was fruſtrated of that hope, for coming there ſhe could not hear any thing of me. She arrived there juſt upon the principal feaſt day in the morning, where the ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes being in number many, gathered there by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe ſolemnities, firſt went all of them into a temple dedicated to <hi>Pan,</hi> where after they had mumbled I know not what kind of rural ſervice for their paſtoral God, they came all out again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fell a dauncing and ſinging; untill ſuch time that <hi>Phoebus</hi> being raiſed to the full height of his courſe, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging right over their heads, they were warned by the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that he ſent from his burning chariot, that they ſhould ſhun the heat of his fiery beams, &amp; under the roof of their barns ſhrowd themſelves from his ſcorching rays. There they fell to their meat, and plied <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> ſo well, that in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola's</hi> opinion they might have held a ſecond feaſt the next day for their honour. After they had ſufficiently recreated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelves with all manner of delicates uſed in the countrey, they hied to the temple again, where paſſing the time as they had done in the morning, ſome kind of afternoon ceremonies added, at length towards evening they returned to their dancing again. Where, in a fair gréen being wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in, with moſt ſtately Cedars, yeelding a more then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhadow vp reaſon that the Sun did caſt his beams libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally againſt the ſides oi theſe trees, haſting to his Weſtern Court, they met all together. The graſſe, was thick under foot, thick and ſhort, as gréen as greenneſſe it ſelf, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrewed with all kinds and colours of ſmall flowers, that it ſéemed rather a footcloath laid there for the Gods to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it with their divine féet, then a pavement for homely ſhepheards to track up and down in. Now over head were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers long chains, made of no other thing but flowers, ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<pb facs="tcp:165993:128"/> twiſted and woven together, that the ſight of them paſſed the gallant Ivory in ſhew, and ſeemed rather to be ropes of Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, and all other kind of Iems and precious Lapidaries, then lines knit of flowers. Theſe chains were croſſe wiſe laid, one overthwarting the other, being many of them in number, and divers in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and were faſtened to the upper branches of the tall Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars that grew about the ſame Paradice.</p>
               <p>In the middeſt and very centre of theſe lines and chains, hung by thrée brave chains wrought after the ſame manner, a moſt gallant garland with a fair lawrel buſh hanging by one line under it, ſo artificially knit and twiſted that both the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the buſh with the lines by which they were faſtened, ſeemed to be wrought by the fine fingers of <hi>Diana,</hi> and either caſt down from heaven unto them, or brought thither by the nymphs of that Country, who had ſo beautified that place for the ſhepheards to ſolemnize their feaſt day according to the worthineſſe and excellency thereof. The garland was to be taken off by him of the enamoured ſhepheards that could ſay beſt for his love, and by him to be given unto her: and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel branch was to be taken down by her of the loving ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes that bore away the praiſe of beſt dancing, and by her to be preſented unto her ſwéet-heart. Inſomuch that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola</hi> deſirous to ſée the procéedings of the country youths in their ſhepheard-like paſtimes, was a ſpectator amongſt them, though longer then the deſire ſhe had to ſée me, could patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow her, yet till ſhe ſaw both their dancing and their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ended. There were about a dozen or half a ſcore of the moſt choice and ſelect ſhepheardeſſes of all that country and part of <hi>Italy,</hi> being daughters to the richeſt farmers therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which maids being all heavenly beauty and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fairneſſe, each purchaſing praiſe even with ſilence, among them danced for the lawrel buſh. Which ſight but to <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> yea and to <hi>Aureola,</hi> ſave when ſhe ſéeketh <hi>Philorenus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (ſaid ſhe when ſhe rehearſed the ſum of her adventures) could not but have béen ſo delightfull and pleaſant, that it would have
<pb facs="tcp:165993:129"/> made them forget themſelves, much more their grief or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Beſides, ſhe remembred that the maid that won the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel was called <hi>Benedetta,</hi> daughter to the old ſhepheard <hi>Roſſeo,</hi> farmer to her ſiſter the Counteſſe <hi>Verina,</hi> and ſhe gave it to a young ſhepheard named <hi>Pardo,</hi> ſon to a rich and wealth? far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of great credit, whoſe name <hi>Aureola</hi> knew not.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His being done, all the maids, they as well that had béen ſpectators as actors in the dance, ſate down on the gréen, al orderly ranked, <hi>Benedet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> as the Quéen, placed in the middeſt of the row, and beheld the action of the young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, who being far more in number that contended for the garland, then there had maids done for the lawrel, yet <hi>Aureola</hi> having her mind ſomething too much buſied with the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome remembrance of me, could not ſo carry away all their names &amp; verſes, but that ſhe forgot the greater part of them. But thoſe which ſhe remembred ſhe imparted unto me, as I am ready to do unto this worthy company, ſeeing I have the papers yet in my pocket. The firſt ſhepheard that ſhould have ſung, was called <hi>Argalo,</hi> being a brave young youth, whoſe face ſeemed to be made by nature, to tell womens eyes that they ſhould perſwade their hearts that he was fair, and whoſe proportion was ſuch as could not but delight. If any fault was in him to <hi>Aureola's</hi> judgment, it was that he ſuſtained too ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a gate for one of his vocation, being an husband-mans or farmers ſon; for modeſt and low behaviour becommeth men of low birth; yet ſhe told me, that his proud erecting of his head and ſetling of his ſhoulders, his feet withall, marching as if he had lead a troop of foot-men to muſter, did (to her mind) as harbingers deliver their meſſages, that the inward loftineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:129"/> of his mind was far greater then in ſhepheards is uſuall. Theſe were his verſes which he not ſung, but with a more then paſtoral grace uttered.</p>

               <p>The ſecond youth that was ready to ſay ſomething for the winning of the garland, was called <hi>Porcio,</hi> and though he was not fair skinned as the former, yet in <hi>Aureola's</hi> eye deſerved as much commendation for comelineſſe as he, yeelding a moſt gracious ſight to their eys that beheld the making of his face. Theſe were his verſes which he ſung to a Citharen, uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſhepheards of that country. And it ſeemed by the ſtrangeneſſe of the tune, that not onely that which he ſung, but alſo that which he played was of his compoſing, having made both the matter and the muſick. By which means he was thought to be ſomething well skilled in playing on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. But O his voice! (ſaid <hi>Aureola</hi>) it was either like to <hi>Orpheus</hi> ſweet note, or it was <hi>Orpheus</hi> voice it ſelf, being through many bodies, at length come within <hi>Porcio,</hi> according as the <hi>Pythogoreans</hi> hold opinion of mens ſouls, that after they iſſue out of their corruptible habitacles, they enter newly into ſome other to maintain their eternity.</p>

               <p>After this <hi>Porcio,</hi> were ſome ſhepheards that ſung to the ſound of a Harp, ſome the ſound of a Viol, ſome to the ſound of their corn-muſe, whoſe vertues for that they were more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate then paſſing, and ſeemed rather to be harbingers of love then of wit, being more pittifull then pithy, ſhe heard them in like manner with a mind mollified with commiſeration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to trouble her memory with the remembrance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But at length ſhe ſpied a little ſhort dapperdy, buſling to come among the reſt with a paper in his hand, wherein his verſes were written in ſuch manner, that a man might have read them as faſt on the backſide of the paper, as he on the inſide. But whether he had his paper, to aſſiſt his weak memory, or to ſhew his cunning that he could both write and read, <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> knew not.

               <p>Next <hi>Polemon,</hi> came an old ſhepheard though never marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who thinking that he had offended <hi>Cupid</hi> to let his young and ſtrong years ſlide and ſlip away, without doing him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, purpoſed to make amends by pining for love in his old days, for ſuch a face had the follow, and a body well befitting

               <p>One more beſide this did <hi>Aureola</hi> mark, whom ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marked, becauſe ſhe judged him worthy to be marked. He was called <hi>Otto,</hi> (and as ſhe had heard) ſonne to a Duke in <hi>France,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Italy</hi> to ſée the country ſaw the fair ſhepheardeſſe called <hi>Laurea,</hi> of whoſe beauty and graces, fame had béen very prodigall; and he having ſéen her with liking, liked her with love, and loved her with conſtancy. In ſomuch that to become hers, he ceaſed to be his own: and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents, land, honour, and living, became a ſhepheard to win the love of <hi>Laurea,</hi> who once had told him that ſhe might fancy no higher then a ſhepheard. But oh heavenly <hi>Laurea,</hi> (quoth <hi>Aureola</hi>) thy modeſty was too great to be of baſe birth, thy humbleneſſe too gratious to be of low parents. No, no, nature hath not wronged thy vertuous beauty, and beauty made more beautifull by virtue, but fortune hath envied at thy perfection. Thou wert found in the wood by old <hi>Panteo,</hi> who poſſeſſeth thée as his daughter, and whom thou for thy bringing up doeſt reverence as thy father; why might not as well hard-hearted Kings as poor beggars have left thée there ſwadled in baſe and poor cloaths? Inſomuch that <hi>Aureola</hi> was fully perſwaded that <hi>Laurea,</hi> was ſome noble born maid, though by fortunes hard intreatment ſhe was not known what ſhe was. Neither did <hi>Aureola</hi> gueſſe amiſſe; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was well known that this <hi>Laurea</hi> was ſiſter to the Dukes ſon that loved her. It fell out after this manner.</p>
               <p>There was great war betwéen the King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Greece.</hi> The King ſent a mighty army into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> to be revenged of the Italians that had aſſiſted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with men and money. Among many other Noblemen that were in the Kings army, was Duke <hi>Otto</hi> this new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſhepheards father, with the Dutcheſs his wife, and young
<pb facs="tcp:165993:131"/> 
                  <hi>Otto</hi> his onely ſon, being of two years old, having no more children then him. It chanced that the Kings army was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Duke and all his retinue taken priſoners, ſaving the Dutcheſſe who was fled unto a certain wood being all alone, where, after ſhe had béen one moneth nouriſhed by a poor old woman that lived a ſolitary life in that wood, ſhe was delivered of <hi>Laurea,</hi> whom ſhe named <hi>Sylva,</hi> after the place where ſhe was born. Within a wéek after the Dutcheſſe had beene brought a bed, died their good old hoſteſs, to her great diſcomfort. But then ſhe takes her child and thinking to march toward ſome village, ſhe went from the cave about ſixe miles, where ſhe eſpied the village where <hi>Laurea</hi> was brought up. And pondering with her ſelf how ſhe might paſſe unknown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that all the inhabitants of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e countries were enemies to the King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſhe layed her child down by a broom buſh becauſe ſhe might go the lighter, meaning to go back to the cave and put on the dead womans cloaths and ſo to return again preſently. But before ſhe could reach to the Cave, ſhe was met withall by a certain Italian Knight, who liked her ſo, that he ſecretly conveyed her to his houſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſhe moſt earneſtly intreated her to let her firſt go fetch her young babe, which ſhe had left but three or four miles off. For he miſtruſted that ſhe had but invented that excuſe to delay the time, and fearing leſt ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might paſs that way before ſhe found the child, among his men carried her to his houſe. The ſame evening <hi>Phebus</hi> having incloſed his heat within his weſtern tower, the old ſhepheard <hi>Panteo,</hi> according to cuſtome, hied to the wood to fetch wood to warm his old limbs the next winter, with the fire he hoped to make of it; and ſo he found young <hi>Sylva</hi> by him called <hi>Laurea.</hi> The Knight being importuned by the Dutches, ſent his men to the wood to ſéek fyr her child, but they could not find it, &amp; therefore could hardly believe but either ſhe lyed, or ſome body elſe had taken it up. The Dutcheſs was daily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by this Knight to yéeld her body to his pleaſure, but ſhe would not: he kept her cloſe priſoner 8 yéers, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> being expired
<pb facs="tcp:165993:132"/> the Knight being beheaded by the command of the Nobility of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of ſome treſpaſs by him committed, and ſome kind of treaſon by him put in practiſe againſt the ſtate of the countrey) ſhe got away, and came to <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe found her husband the Duke <hi>Otto,</hi> but not her ſon, the young <hi>Otto,</hi> who was ſent by his father into <hi>Italy</hi> to ſtudie at <hi>Padua,</hi> to learn the Italian language, and after three or four years ſpace that he had been in <hi>Italy,</hi> he came acquainted with this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſs <hi>Laurea,</hi> towards whom he ſo hotly purſued his ſute, that at length ſhe condiſcended to be his wife, Whereof he as glad as if he had gotten a Kingdome, ſpeedily made a journey towards <hi>France,</hi> intending either to get his fathers good will to marry her, and fetch her home to his Country, or to provide as much money and jewels as he could get, and bid <hi>France</hi> and friends adieu, for that friend. But when he came home, and found his mother there, whom he thought to have been dead many years ſince, and heard her talk of her adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and many other things, how ſhe had had a daughter, and he a ſiſter, and might yet have had, had not Fortune too hardly dealt with her, even as ſoon as ſhe was born, conſidering the circumſtances of time and place, with other points concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, he found <hi>Laurea</hi> to be his own natural ſiſter; Whereof he was glad for her ſake, that ſhe was not of baſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, but ſorry was he (I promiſe you) for his own part, that he might not enjoy that beauty which he ſo loved. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he took the matter, he reſted not till he had by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers help and counſel, brought her home to her parents to the extream joy of them all, and all their friends. Thus (noble Princes and ſhepheards) have you heard the hiſtory of <hi>Laurea,</hi> briefly and verily reported, according as I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince I came to the Lady <hi>Felicias</hi> Court. But becauſe I will not forget to ſet down <hi>Ottos</hi> verſes (by reaſon of which I made this digreſſion in rehearſing his hiſtory) which he ſung to the ſound of a Lute being in ſhepheards attire; for indéed he had a flock of ſhéep in the next village, for the cauſe which I have above declared.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. How Aureola in her journey came to Yervedra; how ſhe was overtaken there by Philorenus the younger, taking him to be his brother Philorenus.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore <hi>Phoebus</hi> had bidden the earth farewell with his weaks countenance untill the next morning. <hi>Aureola</hi> purpoſed to reach to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain village, where ſhe had thought to reſt that night, and at the early appearance of <hi>Aurora</hi> ſhe intended to haſten on her journy. But ſhe being in thoſe quarters, and ill acquainted with thoſe ways, as not over-cunning in finding or going any way, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to come to a fair path, which flanked the village on the right ſide; the fineneſſe of which way ſo liked her (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all things that yeeld but even a taſt of pleaſantneſſe, or ſhew of beauty, preſent great pleaſure and liking unto thoſe that love) that ſhe could not chuſe but go that way; which led
<pb facs="tcp:165993:133"/> her quite paſt the village ſix or ſeven miles before ſhe thought of the village, till being even benighted, ſhe began to wonder that ſhe had not reached to the place ſhe haſted to, having ſo long travelled without ſtaying or reſting either body or mind. For indéed as ſhe went her feet carried her mind ſo faſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a great deal of ground in a little ſpace, that it forgat how to direct their pace to bring the Coach (her precious body) wherein it did ride, to the place where ſhe had purpoſed to reſt.</p>
               <p>But now the knowledge of the place where ſhe was being taken from her by reaſon of the darkneſs, which was a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull meſſenger (ſhe being there alone without any company ſave mine in her mind) that <hi>Phoebus</hi> had with the obſcure curtain of the night cloſed himſelf in his bed, wiſt not what to do; but protecting her body under a large branched tree, from the rain which then fell from the skies, even as tears, witneſſing heavens ſorrow for her miſhap; ſhe laid her tender body down upon the hard earth, which ſéemed to ſhake as panting for gladneſſe of the ſwéet new burthen it did bear.</p>
               <p>There ſhe thought to repoſe her wearied body and grieved mind, hoping by ſléep (the cauſer of forgetfulneſſe) to make truce with her ſorrowfull remembrance for a time. But her reſtleſſe thoughts ſo waked in her, that however her body was at reſt, in mind ſhe travelled ſtill on her queſt after me. The night being paſt, and the morning aproaching, ſhe roſe from her bed (ſoft in no reſpect, but that ſoft ſhe had lain there,) and on ſhe went although ſhe knew not whither, yet whither her féet (led with no certainer guide, then Love and Fortune) did carry her. And having courſed through <hi>Italy</hi> without hearing any thing of me, ſhe viſited the coaſts of <hi>Spain;</hi> for ſhe knew that I was born in thoſe quarters, and ſo began to think, that I might be taken with a deſire to take a view of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (which ſhe reſolved to go to, becauſe it was my Country,) deploring nothing ſo much, as that ſhe had not the luck to ſée it, but with ſéeking but in it, and yet would ſhe have counted that ſéeking but a pleaſure if ſhe might have found me, the end of her deſſrous.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165993:134"/>
               <p>But no, ſhe ſought and ſo ſought that ſhe left no place in the Kingdome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> which ſhe had not ſeen or rather which had not ſeen her, and ſhe could not hear ſo much of me, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever I had been ſéen or heard of in that countrey before, being the place of my birth: the reaſon was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I lived in exile with my father as ſoon as my féet had learned that they had no néed of a bearer. But to be ſhort at length after many a troubleſome journey, ſhe came to the village where I was born, called <hi>Yervedra,</hi> where lodging one night in an old Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers houſe, after ſhe had made ſome enquity after me, ſhe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that I was born in the ſame village: for that old Farmer remembred my name very well, though I think few others could have kept it in memory; but if ſhe had known my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, ſhe had by inquiring for him ſooner have come to <hi>Yervedra.</hi> Yet what was ſhe the better? for when ſhe knew that that was the place of my birth and that ſhe could not hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of me there, then began her hope to fail, and to yéeld to diſpair, inſomuch that weary not ſo much of going any len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as living any longer ſhe wiſhed either that ſhe might find me or death. Yet thanking the old man as heartily and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly as a civil gueſt may an old and friendly hoſt away ſhe got from <hi>Yervedra</hi> thinking to go into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and ſo to ſée the beautifulneſs of that Kingdome which ſhe had ſo much heard ſpoken of. But having paced about a mile from <hi>Yervedra,</hi> ſhe entered into a little Wood, which was nothing either long or large or thick: but ſo pleaſant a place, as that it ſeemed to be made by nature onely to delight the neighbours that dwelled thereabout. Yet could not this place of pleaſure any thing at all mitigate <hi>Aureola's</hi> grief (now even bringing her to the gates of deſpair) but rather increaſed her ſorrow. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was went to be a place where many men came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and recreate their minds in unto her it yéelded a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum of all her misfortunes and adverſities; for no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had ſhe entered into that place, but marking the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, ſhe began to remember the unpleaſantneſs of her own conceits; then began ſhe to be ſorry that ſhe was ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:165993:134"/> with ſorrow; afterwards ſhe became angry with her ſelf in finding ſuch humours; next to that ſhe found fault with Nature for making her ſo unperfect as not able to reſiſt ſuch accidents. But at laſt, paufing at that chancing word acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſhe fell a railing at Fortune, calling her the ſole and onely miſtreſs of all miſchiefs that happen unto men.</p>
               <p>And leaving her there, buſie with her bitter invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fortune (which ſhe did as well as ſhe could do, and could do as well as ſhe would or liſt to do, being provoked thereto with ſuch affections as anger and deſpight armed her withal,) I will in brief manner let you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that after he had béen in divers places and countries (having made more ſpéed and haſt in his ſearch then <hi>Aureola</hi>) at length in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>France,</hi> it was his luck to meet with <hi>Laurea,</hi> firſt called <hi>Sylva,</hi> whoſe hiſtory I have ſhortly rehearſed, untill ſhe was brought home to her fathers houſe by her brother <hi>Otto,</hi> who had among the ſhepheards ſo long courted her, but the reſt of her adventures ſhe her ſelf may declare unto this noble company, opportunity being offered, ſhe being now in this houſe with the Lady <hi>Felicia.</hi> Yet thus much I muſt ſay of her (ſéeing it concerneth our hiſtory) that my brother having found her in the frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> in a defart all alone, very nigh in the ſame plight that <hi>Aureola</hi> was, at firſt when he ſaw her before he ſpake to her, doubted whether it was <hi>Aureola,</hi> for ſhe was ſo drowned in fears, that indeed the judgement of the eye could little prevail at firſt ſight, to diſcern what or who ſhe was.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, gréeting bréeding parley, and parley know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he found that ſhe was ſome other Gentlewoman that was pinched with the ſame pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſhment that tortured <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's</hi> ſoul. But after long talk, they came to like one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers company ſo well, that they purpoſed to travel together into the Caſtilian region, over the bordering mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Inſomuch, that they came into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> before that <hi>Aureola</hi> had been in <hi>Aragon,</hi> where in the famous City of <hi>Civil,</hi> my brother was conſtrained to leave <hi>Laurea,</hi> ſhe having béen dangerouſly ſick; yet before he departed from
<pb facs="tcp:165993:135"/> her, ſhe was ſo amended that danger of death was paſt; yet by reaſon of her weakneſſe ſhe was not like to be able to go on her journey in ſix or ſeven wéeks after. So that he took his leave of her, promiſing her, that if he might make the courſe of his journey ſerve, ſo that he might within a moneth or twain return that way, he would come to her again, and ſo to her no ſmall diſcomfort, parted from her; travelling towards <hi>Aragon,</hi> where he happened to paſſe through the wood where <hi>Aureola</hi> was lamenting her hard luck, and rayling at fortune for ſo hardly uſing her. Inſomuch that my brother before he was by her eyed had eſpied her a far of, and thinking cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it had been ſome other kind of woman for that ſhe had but baſe apparel, having put on the Counteſſe her ſiſters maids cloaths, which he knew not, he went ſoftly and uſed the buſhes for a curtain to hide his body from her ſight, that he might come ſo near that he might learn by her words what ſhe was, for at the firſt ſight he ſtreight perceived that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe was ſhe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which my brother thus interrupted, Nay rather ſweet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola,</hi> let <hi>Philorenus</hi> die to redeem thee from death. She incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently looking back and thinking that it was I (for that ſhe knew not certainly whether my brother had followed from <hi>Naples</hi> to ſeek either of us) fixed her ſo ſtedfaſtly in his face, that her ſoul ſeemed to iſſue out of her body through them, to joyn it ſelf unto him. For ſhe ſunk down, and the knife fel out of her weakned hands, her lips were knit, her tongue tied, her eys turned her colour gone, her body as if it had been without life at all.</p>
               <p>Which diſmal ſight ſo diſmaied my brother; that unleſſe provident Nature had ſtrengthened him, where he ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:165993:136"/> néeded his force, he had certainly véen in no better caſe then <hi>Aureola</hi> her ſelf. But falling down by her he ſtrived to wake her out of that unnatural kind of ſléep, where with much a doe he felt her cruſh his hand between her thumb and her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fingers while he pulled her ſweet hand, to have ſome token of recovery. And at length obtaining the power of her ſight again, turning her eys towards him, ſhe unſealed her faſt cloſed lips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with a ſigh breaking the knots wherewith her tongue was knitted, ſhe ſaid; Ah <hi>Philorenus,</hi> why doeſt thou not revenge the injury offered thee, by her that is cauſe of thy exile? My guilty conſcience accuſeth me, and therefore crave I pardon. My brother was ſo galled with that, becauſe he knew that he was the onely cauſe indeed (though ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will) himſelf, which made me leave the Court, yet becauſe he had told her that I was gone becauſe ſhe ſeemed to love him better then me, and perceiving that ſhe now took him for me, purpoſed for her better comfort to hold her in that opinion: and therefore framed her this anſwer. Lovely <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> thou blameſt thy ſelf to make me bluſh who cannot, but be aſhamed that I have put thee to all this trouble in taking ſo tedious and dangerous a voyage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fraught with ſo much grief and ſorrow, and onely for my fooliſh and raſh departure, being grounded upon no reaſon moving me thereto, but onely the force of my paſſions becomming maſters over reaſon brought me to this abſurdity, and thy ſelf to this extremity, wherein I find you in this place, whither no doubt the Gods pittying your caſe, and hearing your vows, ſent me to ſtay ſo pittifull and tragicall event as otherwiſe had happened. For the Gods themſelves with tears of bloud, would have deplored the death of ſuch a heavenly perſon as is <hi>Aureola.</hi> Why then, what would all the world have done? what mourning would all mortals have made? had they been deprived of that beauty whereof men glory in the Eaſt and Weſt, and where not? Ah ſweet <hi>Aureola,</hi> what ſhould miſerable <hi>Philorenus,</hi> (nay and more then thrice miſerable, being the cauſe and author of ſo great loſſe) have done, who would have, nay doth yet think that

                  </gap>orment neither in hell nor elſewhere, would have been ſufficiently extream to puniſh his offence, in offering unto thee, the world and himſelf, ſuch wrong. Whereupon <hi>Aureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> replied; No no, my heart, thou canſt not offer me no wrong unleſſe it be in doing thy ſelf injury. For I for my part am in thee I am not thine, but thy ſelf, I am not any more <hi>Aureola,</hi> ſeparable from thee or any other diſtinct perſon different un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, but I am even thine own ſelf. And therefore in hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf thou mayeſt harm me, not elſe.</p>
               <p>But here may we leave them (noble Princes and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards) talking together of their adventures hapned to each in their journey, noting this (as I have already admoniſhed) that <hi>Aureola</hi> knew not but that ſhe was with me, and that it was I that came ſo happily unto her in her uttermoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. For my brother to comfort her (though ſo doing he did me diſpleaſure, ſeeing that I rather wiſhed him that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then my ſelf) ſtill diſſembled, not revealing unto her who he was, and ſuffering her to delight her ſelf in that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing opinion, thinking ſhe injoyed my preſence which ſhe then wiſhed for above any other in the world, yea and above his own, whom ſhe before ſeemed to love better then me? Which her change, did ſo tear his loving and brotherlike-heart, that he was peſtred with incredible grief, and yet gloried in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the matter ſucceeded ſo well for me, wiſhing for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that he might find me, to give me <hi>Aureola,</hi> and to ſee us married. For he doubted not but he might uſe ſuch means, that if ever he could find me, ſhe ſhould not know but that it was he whom they joyntly together ſought, and not I. For whereas <hi>Aureola</hi> very earneſtly urged him to return to <hi>Naples</hi> to be married, my brother to hinder that purpoſe ſpake thus unto her. I have been ſaid he by certain ſhepheards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that my brother (you muſt conſider gentle reader, that this is ſpoken of himſelf and ſo to be underſtood, ſeeing he is now of <hi>Aureola</hi> taken for me, in which opinion he did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue her) after he had let you know of my ſudden departure, and afterwards had heard that thereupon you were gone ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb facs="tcp:165993:137"/> from <hi>Naples</hi> to ſeek me, he in like manner taking his leave of the King (having of his Majeſty licenſe thereto) left <hi>Naples</hi> and purſued his queſt after us both. Wherefore (ſaid he) dear <hi>Aureola,</hi> let us firſt ſeek my, nay our dear beloved bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we may all three together return to the Court, and ſo have our marriage feaſt celebrated in full joy, no cauſe of ſorrow eclipſing our mirth. Which perſwaſion printed ſo good a liking in her heart, that he obteined the ſame of her: ſhe being ready to go any where, ſo ſhe went (as ſhe thought) with me. Here (noble Princes and ſhepheards) ſeeing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Felicia</hi> expected our coming to ſupper, will to morrow or ſome other time, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe your worthineſſe to hear the reſt, opportunity being thereto offered.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL the company hearing <hi>Periecrio</hi> ſpeak in this manner, marvelled at the ſame; for they knew nothing how the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> had uſed him in her ſtudy. by giving him the drink of oblivion: And therefore they were amazed to ſee <hi>Perierio,</hi> a man before ſo full of melancholy, and ſo pathetical, now ſo freely ſpeak of Love as one not now in Love, whereunto he was before ſo earneſtly addicted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſeemed to be bound apprentice unto it for ever.

I think they be, fair Princeſſe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Perierio</hi>) for they are not quenched but allayed: and in this degree it is that I commend love, and no doubt but <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> ſo thought of it when ſhe ſo effectually deſcribe it. Yet am not I of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion, anſwered the Dutcheſs, for that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold: whereas if love ſhould do and cauſe all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:165993:138"/> worthy things which <hi>Arethea</hi> attributeth unto it, no doubt it muſt be extended to ſome extream point: or elſe how ſhould it be able to work ſo many excellent matters as ſhe ſpeaketh of, nay rather as truth it ſelf averreth even by the mouth of all ſuch as know the excellency of love? You ſay well quoth <hi>Perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>) but yet I hope you will likewiſe grant that as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, ſo in love alſo there may be an extremity in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which is a vice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to be defended. An extremity (quoth <hi>Briſil</hi>) I grant in this, that one may love too coldly, but too hotly one cannot, in my mind. For ſeeing love is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable as none here gain-ſay it; the more one doth love, the more doth he that which is worthy of commendation, how ſhal we then blame him as doing that which is vicious? For love is not to be conſidered as liberallity or other vertues; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too eaſie in giving and beſtowing, as more then one is able he falleth from liberallity, and cannot be accounted to be liberall but prodigall: in that he laviſhly maketh havock of more then his ability well can allow or reaſon perſwade him. But love the more it poſſeſſeth man, the more he loveth, and the more he loveth, the more he poſſeſſeth. For though by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberal without meaſurs, that ability waineth, and riches decay, yet by loving how extraordinarily ſoever, love never waxeth leſſe nay increaſeth. For the more one loveth, the more ſtill doth his power to love grow, and the more able doth he become to love. And ſo long cannot he fall from love and be accounted no lover, as they that by too much ſpending fall from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> reaſon is governed of love, and not love gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reaſon. For when love hath once taken hold of the heart
<pb facs="tcp:165993:139"/> when it thinketh good, it calleth for the counſell and aſſiſtance of reaſon; but otherwiſe it will not wait or attend upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be directed by it. Neither do I judge them to be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lovers, that in love take counſel of reaſon, or go about to love with reaſon. For they that love indéed, unleſſe they do many ways ſurpaſſe that which reaſon teacheth them, or do more then by reaſon they are moved to do; I think their love to be but of a ſmall account, and ſcarce to be called love. And not to fetch any inſtance a far of, but even from your ſelf, if you had not left your father and your ſiſters (as I have heard you ſay) to ſéek the Lady in whoſe beauty your ſoul danced, and forſaken your country (for ſo I call the place where your dwelling was planted) to travel through deſart places and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known regions, to find out her who was cauſe that you loſt your ſelf; no doubt you would not have thought that you had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; nor any man elſe would have ſaid that you had done ſo. And yet if you had hearkened to reaſon undoubtedly you had not left your aged father and comfortleſſe ſiſters deprived of your company, to ſeek the company of the Lady who fled your company; for reaſon would have conducted an whole army of arguments to diſſwade you from that enterpriſe, which would have been nothing elſe but to force you to ceaſe from love. For certainly had you ſtayed at home, you had either not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at all, or at leaſt but very little béen troubled with paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Inſomuch that you ſée how that reaſon and love cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée together, for they are oppoſite enemies one to the other. And therefore I cannot ſee what love it is that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſay y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> would have guided by reaſon. That love Madam (quoth <hi>Perierio</hi>) which I onely account love, and not I onely, but all ſuch as will not diſgrace the excellency of ſo worthy a thing as love is. For to let you know how I would have love guided with reaſon, I underſtand the matter ſo, that I would have them that love, therein to ſhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch inconveniences as bréed ſhame, infamy, and reproach unto them that love, if they be not avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As to love that which ought not to be loved, as <hi>Paſiphae</hi> loved the Bul by whom ſhe bore <hi>Minotaurus,</hi> many other things
<pb facs="tcp:165993:139"/> which might be conſidered, which onely can be judged by the rule of reaſon. Beſides, I remember many that deſcribe love, (whoſe deſcriptions I like not for my part) ſay, that love is full of diſſembling, hypocriſie, ſtrife, debate, brawling, vice, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, quarrelling, envy, hate, jealouſie, murther, prodigality, gréedineſſe, covetouſneſs anger, and many other miſchievous inconveniences: which I think one that loves may very well avoid all, I mean by the help and counſel of reaſon, which tells us that they ought to be ſhunned.</p>
               <p>Why but good ſir (quoth the Dutcheſs) that love whereof you talk is not love, but luſt, the gulph of all miſchief: for luſt is ſubject to all ſuch vices, and more; but not love. Why then (inferred <hi>Perierio</hi>) muſt you grant, that love not limited by reaſon, is luſt. Nothing ſo (quoth the Dutcheſs:) for love in the very nature and eſſence therof conſidered (otherwiſe it is diverſly taken) is a knot or bond, which tieth, knitteth and uniteth two hearts inſeparably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maketh them one; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that love it ſelf ſo conſidered, to attain to the very purity and ſingularity thereof, is to endeavour and labor by al means whatſoever to the making of them Two hearts One, and to that one thing muſt all actions be directed. Inſomuch, I ſay, that ſuch perſons as will claim the right title of lovers muſt neither be feared with dangers, nor driven back by force, nor chaſed with terrour, nor removed with reaſon, from endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working to make themſelves deſerve to be inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly joyned with that which they love, and to become as the ſame thing it ſelf and one thing with it. Wherein I pray you cannot this be the onely and very force of love and not of luſt? Very well Madam, quoth <hi>Perierio.</hi> So ſir, quoth ſhe, I pray you have you forgotten that you even now ſaid, that you accounted all love not guided by reaſon, luſt? which how groſſely it was ſpoken. I will thus with one ſmall example make you confeſs your ſelf. Put caſe the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> loveth ſome Lady ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her beauty, grace, comlineſs, vertue, or other gifts by God and nature beſtowed on her; which Lady he cannot enjoy as his own, I mean, have her heart united to his, as his is tied
<pb facs="tcp:165993:140"/> to hers and be loved of her as he loveth her, (for there muſt be reciprocation in love) unleſs he ſpend all his Revenues, his Dukedome, and afterward, having obtained his hearts deſire of her, and hath of her heart and his made but one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet cannot enj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now let me ask you this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion would not reaſon, if the Duke had guided his love by the rational meaſure of his underſtanding, have counſelled him not to loſe his credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wealth his renown, and not to have undone himſelf for that which he might not fully enjoy (though he enjoyed as he deſired? It may be ſo, Madam, quoth <hi>Perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> but what then? Marry this (quoth ſhe) Then his love was not guided by reaſon; yet there is no man that will, nay, can ſay, but that it was pure love, not ſpotted with the blot of any luſt: and therefore againſt your former principle, are you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, that all love, not guided by reaſon, is not luſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perierio</hi> marking the ſubtilty of the Dutcheſs, in taking hold of his words and going about to canvas him that way, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe could not go through with her matter, which was to prove, that no love could be too extream great, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right love was not to be guided or governed by reaſon; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let her yet ſo carry it away, made anſwer thus: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things may be ſpoken, which divers ways are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. For ſometimes things properly taken, are improperly applied to ſundry purpoſes. And ſo when I ſaid, that love not not guided by re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut rather for the vice which is committed, by deſiring that which ones affections urge him to covet, and ſo harkening to the lure of his paſſions, boweth his will to their beck, and
<pb facs="tcp:165993:140"/> draweth his will to will that which his affections wil: which may be and is improperly called luſt alſo. For as properly it is ſo called by reaſon of the filthy deſires of the fleſh, ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is it ſo alſo called, for the deſire of ones paſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; when one ſetteth aſide the ſound perſwaſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and applieth his will to follow that which his affections move him unto. And thus did I ſay, that all love not guided by reaſon was luſt, in that they that ſo love do not what reaſon willeth them, but what they lift, and what the will of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as it were forceth them to do.</p>
